       "'Document 1: N.K. Prasada v Government Of India And Ors.\\nSupreme Court of India\\n\\n12 April 2004\\nAppeal (civil) 3137 of 1999\\nThe Judgment was delivered by: S. B. Sinha, J.\\n1.  The appellant herein was respondent No. 8 in one of the public interest litigations being No. 6240 of 1997 which was disposed of along with another public interest litigation being No. 5717 of 1997 and Contempt Case No. 779 of 1997.\\n2.  The appellant herein has not questioned the correctness or otherwise of the impugned judgment dated 6th July, 1998 passed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the aforementioned matters but only is concerned with certain observations made therein as also imposition of a sum of Rs. 20,000/- by way of costs. These two public interest litigations were filed successively by one B. Kistaiah, said to be a former Member of Legislative Assembly and the Writ Petition No. 6240 of 1997 by Digumarthi Premchand, said to be a journalist. In the said purported public interest litigations alleged malfunctioning of the Commissioner of Central Excise resulting in loss of several crores of rupees as also purported dismantling of the Special Investigating Team headed by the appellant herein were in question.\\n3.  The writ petitioners contended that the said Special Investigation Team was dismantled by the Commissioner-I Central Excise & Customs, Hyderabad Commissioner ate only with a view to help the dishonest traders and to prevent the cases relating to evasion of excise duty. The appellant was not initially a party therein but despite the same an order of transfer passed against him and others dated 10.3.1997 bearing Establishment Order (G.O.) No. 43/97 was questioned in the said writ petition. The cause of action for filing writ petition No. 5717 of 1997 was also said to be issuance of the said order of transfer dated 10.3.1997. A Division Bench of the High Court by an order dated 21.03.1997 directed the appellant (although thence he was not a party) not to hand over any record in any pending case which was or is under his investigation to M.V.S. Chowdary till 26.3.1997.\\n4. The respondents were also purported to be relying on or on the basis of the additional affidavit directed by the High Court to file their counter-affidavits and produce the records relating to setting up of the Special Investigation Team and its disbanding. The writ petitioner, however, instructed his counsel to withdraw the writ petition stating:\\n\"My conscience, however, does not permit me to proceed with the said writ petition. I am also uncertain of the effect of the matter will have and I am constrained, for my personal reasons, and for my personal safety to seek the permission of the Hon\\'ble Court to withdraw the writ petition.\"\\n5.  When the said matter was pending, another writ petition marked as W.P. No. 6240 of 1997 came to be filed by Digumarthi Premchand wherein the averments made, except for one paragraph were verbatim the same of those contained in writ petition bearing No. 5717 of 1997. In the said writ petition also the appellant herein was impleaded as a party and the main attack therein was directed against the said proceedings dated 10.03.1997 transferring the appellant.\\n6.  It appears that the Director General, NACEN and Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad by an order dated 08.05.1997 directed that the appellant should be taken back on the rolls of Hyderabad Commissioner ate and furthermore should be handed over the cases for investigation. A further direction was made to examine how his period of absence can be regularised. The writ petitioner filed an application dated 22.5.1997 for implementation of the said proceedings which was marked as WPMP (SR) No. 55758 of 1997. Surprisingly enough, they said application was purported to have been directed to be placed for House Motion before a Division Bench purported to be under the orders of the Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which admittedly was found to be wrong.\\n7. The appellant herein filed two applications on the same day one, to implead him as one of the respondents and the other to give effect to the said proceedings dated 8.5.1997 issued by the Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad. Despite the fact that the Registry of the High Court was not supposed to receive the said applications without the order of the Hon\\'ble Chief Justice, the same was done on a wrong premise that a direction in that behalf had been issued by the Chief Justice. Interestingly, the writ petitioner informed the Registrar (Judicial) that he would not be insisting for House Motion as his advocate would not be available but keeping in view the purported order passed by the Chief Justice, a Bench was constituted in relation where to admittedly no direction had been issued by the Chief Justice. It also stands admitted that even no direction had been issued to number the said applications, whence the application filed by the appellants were placed before the Bench.\\n8.  The Registry submitted several reports before the Court, on having been asked to do so, which reveal as to how a fraud was practised upon the court presumably in collusion with some officers of the Registry. A contempt proceeding was initiated against Digumarthi Premchand relying or on the basis of the said reports but as the writ petitioner had been evading service of notice, not only non-bailable warrant was issued in absence of any correct address of writ petitioner having been furnished; the CBI was also asked to cause to make a detailed enquiry/investigation into the following issues:\\n\"(a) whether there is any person by name Digumarthi Premchand, Journalist, r/o. Narayanaguda and if such a person is available, cause his production before this Court on or before 19-9-1997, (b) if there is no such person by name Digumarthi Premchand, the sixth respondent shall investigate and find out as to under what circumstances this writ petition came into existence and the person or persons responsible for filing the same.\"\\n9.  Upon making an enquiry into the matter, a report was filed by the CBI on 19.9.1997 before the division bench of the High Court. The appellant herein thereafter appeared before the Court on 17.10.1997. The CBI submitted a final report stating that a chargesheet under Section 120-B read with Sections 199, 200, 201, 416, 465 and 471 of Indian Penal Code and Ss. 109 thereof had been filed by it against the writ petitioner, the appellant herein and one M. Kali Prasada who is his close relative. The material portions of the said report read as under:\\n\"On 17-3-1997 Sri N. K. Prasada met one Sri B. Kistaiah an Ex. MLA who had got close association with Sri B. P. Agarwal Textile Mill owner of Shadnagar with whom they said Sri N. K. Prasada also had acquaintance. On the same day Sri Kistaiah filed a WP No.5717 of 1997 alleging irregularities in Customs and Central Excise, Hyderabad and also filed several documents along with writ petition which were supplied by N. K. Prasada. Not contended with filing of the above writ petition Sri N. K. Prasada A2 also got filed another WP No.6240 of 1997 through Sri S. Ramachandra Rao, senior Advocate and Seshagiri Rao, Advocate. Since, the subject-matter of both the writ petitions are one and the same, the Hon\\'ble High Court posted the matter for hearing before Hon\\'ble Justice V. Bhaskar Rao and Hon\\'ble Justice Sri B. Sudarshan Reddy. Sri Padmanabham, clerk of Sri Ramachander Rao informed that on 22-5-1997 Sri N.K. Prasada came to the office of Sri Ramachander Rao and asked him for the house motion petition of D. Premchand and Sri Padmanabham showed him the bundle from which Sri N. K. Prasada took out the petition informing him that he is taking the house motion petition of D. Premchand. Sri N. K. Prasada, (A2) has obtained this writ petition back from the Registrar of the High Court since some objections were raised by the Registrar and Sri N. K. Prasada also signed in return register maintained by the Registrar office in token of receipt of the petition back.\\nThe register as well as specimen signatures of Sri N. K. Prasada have been referred to GEQD who opined that the signatures on the register pertains to Sri N. K. Prasada. The investigation disclosed that the origin of all Phonogram was from public telephone booth bearing No. 243 980, located at Basheerbagh and other PCO telephone No.332917 located at Erramanzil Colony. Investigation disclosed that on the day of filing of WP No.6240 of 1997 i.e., 26-3-1997 Sri Kali Prasada was taken to the office of Sri S. Ramachander Rao by Sri N.K. Pramda and Sri B. P. Agarwal. Investigation also disclosed that on 26-3-1997, Sri D. Premchand was present at Srikakulam and he has not come to Hyderabad nor he signed the affidavit enclose with the WP No.6240 of 1997. The GEQD has opined that the signature on WP No.6240 of 1997 was not that of Sri D. Premchand. But Sri D. Premchand with a fraudulent and dishonest intention filed an affidavit before the Hon\\'ble High Court on 7-11-1997 stating that he himself has signed the affidavit enclosed with the WP No.6240 of 1997 and that he himself filed the petition. Sri S. Ramachander Rao, Sr. Advocate and Sri Seshagiri Rao, Advocate who filed the WP No.6240 of 1997 have also stated in their statements recorded u/s. 164 Cr.P.C before the II MM Hyderabad that the person Sri D. Premchand who had surrendered before Hon\\'ble High Court on 19-9-1997 was not the person who came along with Sri N. K. Prasada and who signed the WP No.6240 of 1997 on 26-3-1997.\\nThe document filed along with WP No.5717 of 1997 of Sri B. Kistaiah, Ex.MLA, Shadnagar were supplied by Sri N. K. Prasada has stated by Sri K. R. Prabhakar Rao, Advocate for Sri B. Kistaiah, Sri B. Kistaiah also stated before the Hon\\'ble High Court that Sri N. K. Prasada requested him not to withdraw the petition. By the aforesaid acts all the accused entered into criminal conspiracy and fraudulently filed WP No.6240 of 1997 and in which process A3 impersonated A1 under the active connivance of A2 and thereby played fraud on the higher judiciary. A1 has falsely stated through an affidavit before the Hon\\'ble High Court of A.P. on 7-11-1997 that he himself filed WP No.6240 of 1997.\\nThus, all the three accused i.e., A1 to A3 committed offences punishable under Section 120-B read with 199, 200, 201, 419, 465 and 471 IPC and S. 109 IPC.\\nIt is therefore prayed that the Hon\\'ble Court may take cognizance of the case against the accused and they may be dealt with according to law. Hence the charge-sheet.\"\\n10.  The CBI was also directed by the High Court by an order dated 19.9.1997 to make investigation into the question as to:\\n\"(1) whether the petitioner, himself, got the information required for the purpose of filing this writ petition and if so, who are the persons from whom the petitioner had gathered the information. It is also just and necessary to find out as to (2) how and on what basis the averments in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition are made and the persons responsible for making or engineering the averments made in the affidavit.\"\\n11.  A direction was also issued to find out as to under what circumstances the writ petitioner proposed to withdraw the writ petition as also who were the person\\'s redsponsible for getting the letter of withdrawal filed by the writ petitioner. The CBI in its report inter alia opined that the appellant herein was the person working behind the scene. Interestingly, during the said investigation the appellant could not be traced out. The aforementioned B. Kistaiah (writ petitioner in W.P. No.6240 of 1997) made a solemn statement before the High Court wherein also he named the appellant herein as a person who was responsible for getting the writ petition filed through the advocate although he did not know him personally. He further alleged that the requisite documents for filing the writ petition have been handed over to the learned Advocate by the appellant.\\n12. The High Court upon analysis of the pleadings and other materials placed before it noticed:\\n\"On analysis of the pleadings before us and various reports filed by the CBI and the sworn statement of the petitioner in WP No.5717 of 1997 would lead to an irresistible conclusion that both these writ petitions are engineered and brought into existence by the 8th respondent herein with an oblique motive of avoiding an order of simple transfer dated 8-5-1997. It is the 8th respondent who has acted from behind the scene and had set up the petitioner to file the writ petition making reckless and unfounded allegations against the respondents. All this has been done only to avoid an order of simple transfer. To what extent the 8th respondent can stoop down is amply demonstrated from the contents of his own affidavit filed into this Court. In one of his counter-affidavits to the report of the CBI dated 17-10-1997 the 8th respondent inter alia states that \"on the day Sri B. P. Agarwal introduced me to the advocate but I had met Sri S. Ramachandra Rao later on my own to seek advice whether I should file in CAT or in High Court. As per his directions, I had given him relevant papers which he said he would examine and advise me accordingly.\\nHowever, without my knowledge or authorisation he used the documents to file a Public Interest Litigation. I came to know much later that the Hon\\'ble High Court has issued certain directions on the PIL filed by B. Kistaiah, At no point of time did I influence or induce anyone to file a petition on my behalf.\"\\nIt is further stated that \"the role of Sri S. Ramachander Rao as a senior Advocate looks very dubious in this context. This is apart from misusing the documents given by me to him in good faith for filing my own petition. This is a clear case of breach of client\\'s confidentiality and interest.\"\\nIt is now clear that it is the 8th respondent who made available the entire material filed into Court as material papers in these writ petitions. Obviously, the writ petition is drafted on the basis of the material supplied by the 8th respondent. It would be totally altogether a different matter as to whether the affidavit is signed by the petitioner or by somebody else at the instance of Respondent No.8. But the feet remains that material has been admittedly made available by the 8th respondent, undoubtedly he is the king pin in the whole drama and operating from behind the scene.\"\\n13.  Before the High Court Shri E. Seshagiri Rao, advocate who had filed the writ petition affirmed an affidavit wherefrom it transpired that the writ petition had been filed from the Office of Shri S. Ramchander Rao, a senior advocate purported to be on the instructions of one Shri B. P. Agarwal, the appellant herein and some other persons.\\n14.  The High Court noticed gross abuse of the process of the Court in the manner of filing the aforementioned two writ petitions said to be in the nature of public interest litigations. The High Court also went into the merit of the matter and arrived at a finding that the writ petitions were filed at the instance of the appellant herein. The High Court while finding the said writ petitions to be without any merit opined that no relief can be granted to the writ petitioner. The High Court also expressed its unhappiness over the role of the lawyers. The High Court although noticed that the writ petitioner in writ petition No. 5717 of 1997 appeared in person and wanted to withdraw the writ petition but did not absolve him of his responsibility in the matter in filing the writ petition at the instance of the appellant herein. However, it took a lenient view and dismissed the writ petition without awarding any cost against him. The High Court, however, administered severe warning to him to be careful in future and not to play any game with judicial process.\\n15.  So far as writ petition No. 6240 of 1997 is concerned, the High Court held:\\n\"So far as WP No.6240 of 1997 is concerned, we have already observed that the petitioner, as well as the 8th respondent are guilty of abuse of the judicial process in the name of public interest litigation. They have put the device of public interest litigation to naked abuse. The weapon invented by the Apex Court with a noble cause intended to serve the deprived sections of the Society pressed into operation for destructive purpose. The streams of justice are polluted by their conduct. We, under those circumstances, consider it appropriate to dismiss the writ petition-Writ Petition No.6240 of 1997 with exemplary costs quantified at Rs.25,000/-(Rupees twenty five thousand only); out of which a sum of Rs.5,000.00 (Rupees five thousand only) shall be paid by the petitioner, Digumarthi Premchand and the remaining sum of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) shall be paid by the respondent No. 8, N. K. Prasada. The amount shall be deposited by the petitioner and the 8th respondent with A.P. State Legal Services Authority.\"\\n16.  In the contempt proceedings the writ petitioner was found guilty and punishment till the rising of the court was awarded to the writ petitioner. The High Court, however, keeping in view the pendency of the criminal case observed:\\n\"However, we would like to make very clear that we have not expressed any opinion whatsoever with regard to the merits of the prosecution and the charge-sheet filed by the CBI against the petitioner as well as 8th respondent and one Kali Prasada. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial uninfluenced by any of the observations made by us in this order. We have not expressed any opinion about any of the aspects and merits of the allegations levelled against the petitioner and the 8th respondent. The observations, if any, made by this Court while referring to the reports of the CBI and the charge-sheet are confined for the purpose of disposal of this writ petitions and the contempt case. The trial Court shall dispose of the criminal case uninfluenced by any observation whatsoever made in this case.\"\\n17.  Contentions of Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant are two-fold. Firstly he drew our attention to a First Information Report purported to have been lodged by him against one T.N. Rao, Dy. S.P. CBI Hyderabad and urged that as the said officer had himself been facing a criminal charge of asking for bribe, his report filed before the High Court should not have been relied upon. The learned counsel would secondly urge that although the appellant was impleaded as a party, no opportunity of hearing having been granted to him the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.\\n18.  Mr. Anoop G. Choudhary, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, would submit that the High Court itself could have been moved for expunction of the remarks by the appellant herein. It was pointed out that the appellant took part in the CBI enquiry, filed an application for regularisation of leave and keeping in view the report submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation, his involvement in getting the writ petition filed is apparent on the face of the record.\\n19.  The writ petitioner who had been arrayed as respondent No. 8 in the Special Leave application has filed an affidavit. He in his affidavit does not deny or dispute the findings of the High Court. He does not say that the writ petition was not filed at the instance of the appellant herein. It is not in dispute that although the appellant was not a party in the writ petition the order of transfer passed against him dated 10.3.1997 was the subject matter thereof and an interim order had been passed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The fact that he derived benefit of the said interim order is not denied or disputed. The fact that he filed two applications, one for imp leading himself as a party in the pending writ proceeding and another for an interim order purported to be for implementing the order of the Chief Commissioner dated 08.05.1997 also stands admitted.\\n20.  We may recall that the original writ petitioner also filed a similar application. The High Court arrived at its conclusion not only on the basis of the report of the Central Bureau of Investigation which, inter alia, contains the statements of the clerk of Shri S. Ramchandra Rao, Advocate and his involvement in filing the application and taking the same back from the Registry which is borne out of the return register maintained by the Registry but also the detailed reports submitted by the Registrar (Judicial) before the High Court from time to time as also other affidavits, sworn statements and other materials brought on record. As the finding of the High Court is to the effect that the appellant herein was the king pin of the entire episode and had engineered the entire game with a view to getting his order of transfer stayed is prima facie in nature, we do not find any reason to interfere therewith.\\n21.  The writ petition and the contempt proceedings pending before the High Court were disposed of on the basis of the materials on record. The materials not only included affidavits of the parties as also that of the appellant but also the sworn statements of the writ petitioner and the Advocate appearing for the writ petitioner. In view of the fact that even the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner categorically stated that at the time of drawing of the writ petition the appellant was present, no fault with the findings of the High Court can be found out if reliance had been placed thereupon. The appellant had intervened in the writ applications as far back as on 22.5.1997. He, it will bear repetition to state, filed an application for grant of an interim relief. The same was pending and, thus, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever, having regard to the fact that the Central Bureau of Investigation was making enquiry; the appellant herein must be held to have been aware thereabout.\\n22. His two applications were also pending and presumably pressed (as there is nothing on record to show that at any point of time, he intended to withdraw the same), and thus a presumption can be drawn to the effect that he/his advocate had been keeping a watch over the entire proceeding. Despite the same at no point of time the appellant wanted to cross-examine any witness. He never brought the fact to the notice of the court that a criminal case had also been filed against the Dy. S.P. of the C.B.I. allegedly for taking bribe. He allowed the proceedings before the High Court to go on. He sat on the fence. He, as has been noticed by the High Court, even could not be traced out for some time. Furthermore, he appeared to be on leave during the following period:\\n\"1. 83 days EL from 3-4-1997 to 24-6-1997.\\n2. 138 days EL from 26-6-1997 to 10-11-1997.\\n3. 15 days EL from 11-11-1997 to 25-11-1997.\\n4. 115 days Half-pay leave from 26-11-1997 to 29-4-1998.\\n5. 32 days extraordinary leave from 30-4-1998 to 31-5-1998.\"\\n23.  He, as noticed hereinbefore, filed application for regularisation of the said period of leave pursuant to or in furtherance of the observations made by the Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad in his order dated 08.05.1997.\\n24.  The principles of natural justice, it is well-settled, cannot be put into a strait-jacket formula. Its application will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It is also well-settled that if a party after having proper notice chose not to appear, he a later stage cannot be permitted to say that he had not been given a fair opportunity of hearing. The question had been considered by a Bench of this Court in Sohan Lal Gupta (Dead) through LRs. and Others Vs. Asha Devi Gupta (Smt.) and Others [(2003) 7 SCC 492 2003 Indlaw SC 719] of which two of us (V.N. Khare, CJI and Sinha, J.) are parties wherein upon noticing a large number of decisions it was held:\\n\"29.The principles of natural justice, it is trite, cannot be put in a straitjacket formula. In a given case the party should not only be required to show that he did not have a proper notice resulting in violation of principles of natural justice but also to show that he was seriously prejudiced thereby...\"\\n25.  The principles of natural justice, it is well-settled, must not be stretched too far.\\n26.  In any event, it is not a case where this Court should exercise its discretion in favour of the appellant. It is trite that in a given case, the Court may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction u/art. 136 of the Constitution. (See Chandra Singh and Others Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another [(2003) 6 SCC 545 2003 Indlaw SC 541] and State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Savinderjit Kaur [JT 2004 (3) SC 4702004 Indlaw SC 227]\\n27.  The scope of public interest litigation has recently been noticed by this Court in Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and Another vs. C. K. Rajan and others [(2003) 7 SCC 546 2003 Indlaw SC 633] holding:\\n\"...Statutory functions are assigned to the State by the Legislature and not by the Court. The Courts while exercising its jurisdiction ordinarily must remind itself about the doctrine of separation of powers which, however, although does not mean that the Court shall not step-in in any circumstance whatsoever but the Court while exercising its power must also remind itself about the rule of self-restraint. The Courts, as indicated hereinbefore, ordinarily is reluctant to assume the functions of the statutory functionaries. It allows them to perform their duties at the first instance.\\nThe court steps in by Mandamus when the State fails to perform its duty. It shall also step in when the discretion is exercised but the same has not been done legally and validly. It steps in by way of a judicial review over the orders passed. Existence of alternative remedy albeit is no bar to exercise jurisdiction u/art. 226 of the Constitution of India but ordinarily it will not do so unless it is found that an order has been passed wholly without jurisdiction or contradictory to the Constitutional or statutory provisions or where an order has been passed without complying with the principles of natural justice. (See Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others (1998) 8 SCC 1 1998 Indlaw SC 13).\\nIt is trite that only because floodgates of cases will be opened, by itself may not be no ground to close the doors of courts of justice. The doors of the courts must be kept open but the Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground realities while entertaining a public interest litigation.\\nExercise of self-restraint, thus, should be adhered to, subject of course to, just exceptions.\"\\n(See also Maharashtra State Board of Secondary Education Vs. Paritosh Bhupesh Kumarsheth etc., AIR 1984 SC 1543 1984 Indlaw SC 322.)\\n28.  The said decision has been followed in Chairman & MD, BPL Ltd. vs. S.P. Gururaja and Others [(2003) 8 SCC 567 2003 Indlaw SC 860], wherein it was noticed:\\n\"Dawn Oliver in Constitutional Reform in the UK under the heading \\'The Courts and Theories of Democracy, Citizenship, and Good Governance\\' at page 105 states:\\n\"However, this concept of democracy as rights-based with limited governmental power, and in particular of the role of the courts in a democracy, carries high risks for the judges-and for the public. Courts may interfere in advisedly in public administration. The case of Bromley London Borough Council v. Greater London Council ([1983] 1 A.C. 768 , HL) is a classic example. The House of Lords quashed the GLC cheap fares policy as being based on a misreading of the statutory provisions, but were accused of themselves misunderstanding transport policy in so doing. The courts are not experts in policy and public administration-Jowell\\'s point that the courts should not step beyond their institutional capacity (Jowell, 2000). Acceptance of this approach is reflected in the judgments of Laws LJ in International Transport Roth GmbH Vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department ([2002] EWCA Civ. 158 : [2002] 3 W.L.R. 344) and of Lord Nimmo Smith in Adams v. Lord Advocate (Court of Session, Times, 8 August 2002) in which a distinction was drawn between areas where the subject matter lies within the expertise of the courts (for instance, criminal justice, including sentencing and detention of individuals) and those which were more appropriate for decision by democratically elected and accountable bodies. If the courts step outside the area of their institutional competence, government may react by getting Parliament to legislate to oust the jurisdiction of the courts altogether. Such a step would undermine the rule of law. Government and public opinion may come to question the legitimacy of the judges exercising judicial review against Ministers and thus undermine the authority of the courts and the rule of law.\"\\nIn Onkarlal Bajaj and Others Vs. Union of India and Another [(2003) 2 SCC 673 2002 Indlaw SC 1577] it was observed:\\n\"The expression \\'public interest\\' or \\'probity in governance\\', cannot be put in a straitjacket. \\'Public interest\\' takes into its fold several factors. There cannot be any hard and fast rule to determine what is public interest the circumstances in each case would determine whether Government action was taken is in public interest or was taken to uphold probity in governance. The role model for governance and decision taken thereof should manifest equity, fair play and justice. The cardinal principle of governance in a civilized society based on rule of law not only has to base on transparency but must create an impression that the decision-making was motivated on the consideration of probity. The Government has to rise above the nexus of vested interests and nepotism and eschew window dressing. The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or capricious actions.\\nTherefore, the principle of governance has to be tested on the touchstone of justice, equity and fair play and if the decision is not based on justice, equity and fair play and has taken into consideration other matters, though on the face of it, the decision may look legitimate but as a matter of fact, the reasons are not based on values but to achieve popular accolade, that decision cannot be allowed to operate.\"\\n29.  We are pained to see how the forum of public interest litigation is being abused. This Court recently had also the occasion to notice the same. (See Ashok Kumar Pandey Vs. State of West Bengal, 2003 AIR SCW 6105 2003 Indlaw SC 1010 and Dr. B. Singh Vs. Union of India and Others, 2004 AIR SCW 1494 2004 Indlaw SC 196).\\n30.  For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly. No costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\\n\\nDocument 2: Supreme Court Legal and Committee Representing v Union Of India\\nSupreme Court of India\\n\\n7 October 1994\\nW.P. (Cr.) No. 307 of 1993 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)\\nThe Judgment was delivered by: AHMADI, J.\\n1. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (61 of 1985), hereinafter alluded to as \"the Act\", was enacted inter alia to make stringent provisions for the control and regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and for matters connected therewith. The enactment received the President\\'s assent on 16-9-1985. The dictionary of the Act is to be found in S. 2 thereof. S. 2(xxix) says that words and expressions used in the Act and not defined but defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, hereinafter called \"the Code\", shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Code. The Act is divided into six chapters comprising 83 sections.\\nSince in the instant case we are concerned with only a few provisions we need not examine the scheme of the Act. We had an occasion to examine the scheme of the Act in some detail in Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of India ( 1990 Indlaw SC 990 : 1990 Indlaw SC 990). Chapter IV defines the offences and prescribes stringent punishments, with minimum punishments and fines for them. For certain offences the punishment prescribed can extend to rigorous imprisonment for 20 years and a fine of Rupees two lakhs, with a minimum rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of Rupees one lakh.\\n2. By S. 37 offences punishable under the Act are made cognizable and non-bailable. Where the offender is accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment of 5 years or more, the section provides that he shall not be released on bail or on his own bond unless (i) the Public Prosecutor has had an opportunity to oppose the bail and (ii) if bail is opposed, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty and is not likely to indulge in the commission of similar offences.\\n3. By Amending Act No. 2 of 1989, styled as the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Act, 1988, far-reaching changes came to be made in the Act. This Amending Act came into force with effect from 29-5-1989, vide S. O. 379(E) of even date. By this Amending Act the punishment prescribed under the newly added Section 31-A for certain offences extended to death penalty also. S. 36 came to be replaced by a new provision and Sections 36-A to 36-D were inserted for the first time. The substituted Section 36, insofar as relevant for our purpose reads thus\\n\"36. Constitution of Special Courts. - (1) The Government may, for the purpose of providing speedy trial of the offences under this Act, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute as many Special Courts as may be necessary for such areas as may be specified in the notification\\n(2) A Special Court shall consist of a Single Judge who shall be appointed by the Government with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court.\"\\n4. Only a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge is eligible to be appointed a Special Judge. Under Section 36-A, all offences under the Act \\'shall\\' be triable only by the Special Court constituted for the area in which the commission of the offence has taken place. This provision overrides the provisions in the Code. Section 36-B clarifies that appeals and revisions from the orders passed by the Special Courts shall lie to the High Court as if they were passed by a Sessions Court.\\nSection 36-C provides for the application of the provisions of the Code to proceedings before the Special Court as if the Special Court is a Court of Session, unless the Act provides otherwise. We then come to Section 36-D which may be reproduced at this stage. It reads\\n\"36-D. Transitional Provisions. - (1) Any offence committed under this Act on or after the commencement of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Act, 1988, until a Special Court is constituted under Section 36, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be tried by a Court of Session\\nProvided that offences punishable under Sections 26, 27 and 32 may be tried summarily\\n(2) Nothing in sub-s. (1) shall be construed to require the transfer to a Special Court of any proceedings in relation to an offence taken cognizance of by a Court of Session under the said sub-s. (1) and the same shall be heard and disposed of by the Court of Session.\"\\n5. It becomes immediately clear that before the introduction of the present group of provisions by Amending Act No. 2 of 1989, the offences under the Act were triable by the ordinary courts under the Code. However, after the enactment of the Act it was expected that speedy trials and harsh punishments would help prevent and combat abuse of and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, etc., and rid the society of drug menace. But it was soon realised that the aim of bringing the culprits to book with dispatch was not achieved.\\nThe legislature, therefore, though that the aim of speedy trials may be achieved if Special Courts are constituted to try offences under the Act. This objective is clearly writ large in the text of S. 36 which in no uncertain terms says that the Government may constitute Special Courts \"for the purpose of providing speedy trial of offences under this Act\". That is why Section 36-A posits that all offences under the Act shall be triable \\'only\\' by the Special Court constituted for the area under Section 36, notwithstanding anything in the Code. Cl. (d) of sub-s. (1) of Section 36-A empowers the Special Court to take cognizance of an offence under the Act upon a police report or upon a complaint made by an authorised officer.\\n6. Section 36-C extends the provisions of the Code to proceedings before the Special Court, save as otherwise provided in the Act, so that where the Act does not make any specific provision to the contrary, the Special Court may not be hamstrung and may lean on the provisions in the Code. But then till the establishment of the Special Courts, provisions had to be made to cover the transitional period to avoid a stalemate situation and hence and need for Section 36-D. The importance of this provision is realised when we take notice of the fact that in many State the constitution of Special Courts was delayed by a couple of years or even more\\n7. The provision made in Section 36-D assumes considerable importance in deciding the principle question which arises in this case. But before we indicate the backdrop in which the question falls for decision, it may be advantageous to understand the true scope and import of this transitional provision. The section applies to cases where the offence referred to under the Act been committed on or after the commencement of the Amendment Act i.e., 29-5-1989. It has no application to offence committed before 29-5-1989. Offence committed under the Act on and after 29-5-1989 would have to be tried by the Special Court constituted for the area in view of cl. (a) of sub-s. (1) of Section 36-A. But the legislature was aware that there may be a time-gap between the coming into force of the provisions contained in Ss. 36 and 36-A and the constitution of the Special Court for the area concerned.\\nIt has, therefore, provided that offence committed under the Act on or after 29-5-1989 shall be tried by a Court of Session until a Special Court for the area is constituted under Section 36, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code.\\n8. Therefore, offences committed before 29-5-1989 would be continued to be tried by courts constituted under the Code. Sub-s. (2) of Section 36-D clarifies that nothing in sub-s. (1) shall be construed to require the transfer of any proceedings to a Special Court if the Court of Session has taken cognizance of the offence under sub-s. (1). Once the Court of Session has taken cognizance of an offence committed on or after 29-5-1989, at a time when the Special Court was not in existence, such a case will not be required to be transferred to the Special Court subsequently constituted, and the same would have to be heard and disposed of by the Court of Session.\\nThus, proceedings which have commenced before the Court of Session in respect whereof it has taken cognizance before the establishment of the Special Court shall be heard and disposed of by the former which implies that cases pending before the Court of Session in relation whereto it has not taken cognizance would have to be transferred to the Special Court on its constitution\\n9. S. 36 of the Act lays down the mode for the constitution of a Special Court. It provides that Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute as many Special Courts as may be necessary for the areas to be specified in the notification. Therefore, as soon as the notification contemplated by S. 36 is published in the Official Gazette constituting one or more Special Courts for the areas to be specified in the notification, the Special Court comes into existence. Sub-s. (2) says that the Special Court shall consist of Single Judge appointed by the Government in the manner provided by that sub-section. Sub-section (2), therefore, indicates the strength of the Special Court, that is to say it will consist of a Single Judge\\n10. We may now give an abridged version of the factual matrix. A large number of cases in relation to offences under the At were detected in Bombay and prosecutions were launched against the offenders. Until 28-5-1989, these cases were being dealt with by courts having jurisdiction under the Code. Judicial Magistrates, where they had jurisdiction, depending on the maximum sentence provided for the offence concerned, dealt with such cases but where the sentence prescribed conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Session, orders of committal of such cases came to be passed. As the number of such cases was large, there was accumulation of work in the Court of Session of Bombay. The Sessions Judge, Bombay, distributed such cases amongst his colleagues who were Additional Sessions Judges.\\nHowever, the distribution was so made that there was accumulation of such work in the Court of Single Additional Sessions Judge, Shri Pathan. After the insertion of Sections 36, 36-A and 36-D by the Amending Act No. 2 of 1989, the State Government published on 4-1-1991, a notification constituting two Special Courts for Greater Bombay. By a subsequent notification dated 6-4-1991 published in the Official Gazette Shri Pathan was appointed a Judge of one of the Special Courts constituted by the notification of 4-1-1991.\\nOn the retirement of Shri Pathan, Shri Ghare succeeded him with effect from 25-2-1992. When certain bail applications were taken up by Shri Ghare, a contention was raised that in cases in which the Court of Session had taken cognizance before the constitution of the Special Court, the latter had not jurisdiction, a contention which found favour with the learned Judge. This gave rise to the question whether the learned Judge was right in the view taken by him. The issue came up before the Bombay High Court in certain criminal applications preferred by the department as well as the accused persons. Daud, J. who heard these applications put the issue a little broadly, in that, he covered offences committed not only prior to 4-1-1991, the date on which the notification constituting Special Courts was issued and published in the Official Gazette, but also offence up to 5-4-1991, the date on which the notification appointing Shri Pathan was issued and published in the Official Gazette.\\n11. This has given rise to the question - when is a court constituted ? Daud, J., after pointing out the divergence of views between different High Courts, approved the view expressed by Hansaria, C.J., (as he then was) in Bhagwan Singh v. State of Orissa ( 1992 (2) CCR 1237 ) departing from the view expressed by Deshpande, J., of the same High Court in Suryakant Ramdas More v. State of Maharashtra ( 1989 Indlaw MUM 242 : (1898) 2 Bom CR 653 (Bom HC). We may incidentally mention that the view expressed by Hansaria, C.J., on the need for a committal order by a Magistrate before the Sessions Judge can take cognizance was not approved by the Full Bench of the Orissa High Court in Banka Das v. State of Orissa ( 1993 (75) CLT 225 (Ori)). Daud, J., also took the view that the Special Court could be said to have been legally constituted on 6-4-1991.\\nHe, therefore, concluded that in respect of offence committed between 29-5-1989 and 6-4-1991, during which period the Special Courts were not in existence, the Court of Session only could exercise jurisdiction in view of the clear language of Section 36-D. This is how the learned Judge sums up\\n\"In respect of cases relating to offences committed prior to 28-5-1989, trial of these cases was to be governed under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In respect of such cases if the Magistrates were empowered to award the sentences prescribed by the different sections, they could deal with the matters. Where the offences were punishable with imprisonment for 10 years and more, the Magistrates had to commit the offenders to stand trial in the Court of Session. The second category was that of persons who had committed offence under the Act between 29-5-1989 and 5-4-1991. Such offences were to be tried by a Court of Session under sub-s. (1) of Section 36-D of the NDPS Act. Judge Ghare seems to have made a distinction between offences committed in the period 4-1-1991 to 5-4-1991. This seems to rest on his making a distinction between the creation of a court and the appointment of a Judge to man it. The distinction is without any significance for the constitution would be incomplete unless a Judge is appointed to man the created Special Court.\\n12. The third category would be offences committed after 5-4-1991. Here, the jurisdiction would unquestionably be that of the Special Court. Judge Ghare has to be sustained when he says that he does not have jurisdiction to entertain cases relating to offences committed prior to 4-1-1991. As a matter of fact the disability extends right up to 5-4-1991.\"\\n13. Before Daud, J. rendered his decision on 1-8-1992, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shri Ghare had made a reference to the High Court u/s. 395(1) of the Code relating to certain foreign nationals who were languishing in jails for long periods for the commission of offence under the Act. This reference was heard and answered by a Division Bench of the High Court on 18-9-1992. While answering the reference the Division Bench comprising Kurudukar and Saldhana, JJ. dealt with the question regarding the true meaning and scope of Section 36-D(2) of the Act. In doing so it noticed the decision rendered by Daud, J., only a few days before. After referring to the relevant provisions of the Act and the case-law bearing on the point, Kurudukar, J. (as he then was) who spoke for the Bench observed\\n\"U/s. 36(1) the Government may constitute a Special Court/Courts and such constituted Court/Courts shall be manned by Judges in terms of S. 36(3) of the Act.\\nThere could be a situation like a present one, where the Government has issued notification constituting Special Court/Courts under the Act, but the notification appointing Judges to man such Court/Courts was not issued simultaneously but issued after some time, then in such a situation Court/Courts constituted under ordinary criminal law of the land (Code) will have jurisdiction to try offences committed under the Act. This period i.e. until Judges are appointed, would be a transitional period covered by Section 36-D(1) of the Act. Section 36-D is a deeming provision and requires to be given its true meaning having regard to the object of Act 2 of 1989. Court of Session will be deemed to be \\'as if a Special Court\\'. Unless we read this deeming provision in Section 36-D(1) of the Act true meaning thereof cannot be assigned and any other construction of this sub-section will render the object in enacting this sub-section nugatory.\"\\n14. Then in the light of what he called the deeming provision, the learned Judge proceeded to ascertain the true meaning of Section 36-D(2), and held that\\n\"if Section 36-A(1) (a) and 36-D(1) and (2) are read together it leaves no manner of doubt that Section 36-D has been enacted to cover such transitional period where the Special Court is not constituted in the real sense and trial has commenced before the Court of Session\"\\nThe Division Bench then adverted to the views of Daud, J., that unless a Judge is appointed to the Special Court, the Special Court cannot be said to have been constituted under the Act and consequently cases in which cognizance has been taken by the Court of Session upto 6-4-1991 would fall outside the purview of the Special Court, and proceeded to observe:\\n\"From this unreported decision it appears that the contention as regards deeming provision under Section 36-D was not raised before the learned Single Judge. Consequently, the learned Single Judge had no occasion to consider the effect of the deeming provision contained in Section 36-D(1) of the Act. With great respect to the learned Single Judge, we are unable to agree with the view taken by him in this unreported decision. In the view which we have taken, this unreported decision needs to be overruled and we do so.\"\\n15. The Division Bench in the ultimate concluded that (i) cases filed under the Act prior to 29-5-1989 shall be tried by the Court of Session, (ii) cases filed on and after 29-5-1989 shall be tried by the Special Court constituted under the Act and (iii) if cognizance of a case is taken by a Sessions Court, during transitional period in the absence of constitution of Special Court in the real sense, the Sessions Court shall not be required to transfer the case to be Special Court if it has substantially proceeded with the trial. With respect, there are two aspects of the judgment which are difficult to comprehend, firstly, reference to the deeming provision in Section 36-D(1) - there is no such deeming provision therein - and\\nsecondly, reference to the constitution of the Special Court in the real sense after overruling Daud, J. that the constitution is complete only after the appointment of a Judge to the Special Court. The Division Bench, therefore, is largely in agreement with the view expressed by Daud, J. except that cases pending with the Court of Session from 4-1-1991 to 5-4-1991 would also triable by that court if it has taken cognizance but here again as pointed out above there is some confusion when the Division Bench carves out an exception that if during the transitional period there is no constitution of the Special Court \"in the real sense\" and the case has proceeded \\'substantially\\' before the Court of Session, it will not be necessary to transfer it to the Special Court\\n16. In order to answer the point arising for our determination we may first refer to a few provisions of the Code. By virtue of S. 4(1) all offences under the Indian Penal Code have to be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code. S. 4(2) provides that all offences under any other law shall be similarly investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with under the Code, subject of course to any law for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. S. 6 provides that except the High Courts and courts constituted under any other law, i.e., other than the Code, there shall be, in every State the following classes of Criminal Courts, namely\\n(i) Courts of Session;\\n(ii) Judicial Magistrates, First Class or Metropolitan Magistrates;\\n(iii) Judicial Magistrates, Second Class; and\\n(iv) Executive Magistrates.\\n17. The powers of different courts have been indicated in Chapter III. The High Court or Court of Session can try any offence under the Penal Code and pass any sentence authorised by law, but a sentence of death if passed by the Sessions Court would be subject to confirmation by the High Court. A Chief Judicial Magistrate and a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate may pass a sentence for a term not exceeding seven years. A Judicial Magistrate of the First Class and Metropolitan Magistrate are empowered to pass a sentence for a term not exceeding three years. S. 209 provides that when an accused appears or is brought before a Magistrate and it appears that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, the Magistrate shall commit the case to the Court of Session.\\n18. It will, thus, be seen that where an offence is exclusively triable by the Court of Session, the Magistrate is enjoined by law to pass an order committing the case to the Court of Session for trial. Once the case is committed, the Court of Session can take cognizance at any time thereafter\\n19. Now under the Act different punishments have been prescribed for different offences ranging from six months to twenty years and even death to those with previous conviction. Therefore, under the Code some of the offences would be triable by a Magistrate of the First Class or Metropolitan Magistrate, some by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the rest by the Court of Session. This was the position till the Act underwent changes by virtue of the amendments introduced by Amending Act No. 2 of 1989. The introduction of Sections 36, 36-A, to 36-D changed the situation\\n20. S. 36 provides for the constitution of Special Courts and Section 36-A(1)(a) says that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, all offences under the Act shall be triable only by Special Court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed or where there are more Special Courts than one for such area, by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by the Government. On a conjoint reading of these two provisions it becomes clear beyond any manner of doubt that once a Special Court (or more than one) has been constituted for an are or areas in which the offence has been committed, then notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, the Special Court alone will have jurisdiction and all other courts exercising jurisdiction prior to the constitution of the Special Courts will cease to have jurisdiction.\\nSub-sections 36-A(1)(a) and (d) which also begin with a non-obstante clause - notwithstanding anything contained in the Code - provided that a Special Court may, upon a perusal of the police report of the facts constituting an offence under the Act or upon a complaint made by an officer of the Government concerned authorised in this behalf, take cognizance of that offence without the accused being committed to it for trial. This is a provision which is analogous to S. 190 of the Code. It is clear from this provision that a Special Court may take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial. Section 36-C makes the provisions of the Code applicable to proceedings before a Special Court, save as otherwise provide in the Act, and says that the Special Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Session.\\n21. That brings us to Section 36-D which is a transitional provision. Under sub-s. (1) of Section 36-D any offence committed under the Act on or after the commencement of the Amendment Act, 1988, until a Special Court is constituted under Section 36, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, be tried by a Court of Session. The non-obstante clause in this provision makes it clear that until a Special Court is constituted under Section 36, the Court of Session shall try any offence committed on or after the commencement of the Amendment Act and no other court including the Magistrate\\'s Court will have jurisdiction to try an offence under the Act. Sub-s. (2) of Section 36-D further provides that nothing in sub-s. (1) shall be construed to require the transfer to a Special Court of any proceeding in relation to an offence taken cognizance of by the Court of Session under sub-s. (1) and the same shall be continued, heard and decided by the latter court.\\nAs we have pointed out earlier before this group of sections came to be introduced in the Act by the Amending Act 2 of 1989 with effect from 29-5-1989, the offences under the Act were triable by different courts under the Code depending on the punishments provided therefor. But after the introduction of this group of sections in the Act, the legislature, with a view to speeding up the trial provided for the constitution of a Special Court and until such court was constituted it provided by sub-s. (1) of Section 36-B that the Court of Session will have jurisdiction to try any offence committed under the Act; the provisions in the Code notwithstanding.\\n22. The effect of this provision is to vest jurisdiction in the Court of Session alone during the transitional period in respect of offences under the Act even where the punishment prescribed is three years or less. Ordinarily the Magistrate\\'s Court would have power to try the offence under the Code but by this provision the power is vested in the Court of Session alone, and therefore, the Courts of the Magistrates, First Class, Metropolitan Magistrates, Chief Judicial Magistrates and Chief Metropolitan Magistrates would cease to have jurisdiction. Sub-s. (1) of Section 36-A overrides the provisions of the Code. So, from the date of its introduction on the statute book the Magisterial Courts ceased to have jurisdiction or power to try any offence committed under the Act even if the punishment prescribed is three years or less since only the Court of Session is empowered to deal with such cases.\\nThere would, therefore, be no question of the Magistrate going through the exercise of committal proceedings as on account of the non-obstante clause in Section 36-D(1) (a), all offences under the Act become triable only by the Court of Session till the constitution of Special Courts and thereafter by the Special Court. Ordinarily, therefore, cases pending before the Court of Session by virtue of Section 36-D(1) would be transferred to the Special Court, but sub-s. (2) of Section 36-D carves out an exception in relation to an offence of which the Court of Session has already taken cognizance. Where the Court of Session has already taken cognizance under sub-s. (1) of Section 36-D that court will be entitled to hear and dispose of the case and will not be required to transfer the same to the Special Court of the area by virtue of the exception carved out by sub-s. (2) of Section 36-D.\\n23. On a conjoint reading of Sections 36, 36-A to 36-D, it seems clear to us that after the insertion of these provisions all offences under the Act have to be tried by the Special Court for the area constituted u/s. 36. That is the thrust of cl. (a) of sub-s. (1) of Section 36-A. but the legislature was aware that there may be a time-gap between the coming into force of these provisions w.e.f. 29-5-1989 and the constitution of a Special Court. This period which is a transitional period is taken care of by Section 36-D of the Act. Under this provision during the transitional period offences committed under the Act would be tried by the Court of Session alone notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code. But once the Special Court is constituted under S. 36 that court alone would have jurisdiction to try the offences under the Act save and except those in relation whereto the Sessions Court has already taken cognizance.\\nIt is not necessary to elaborate on when cognizance is understood to have been taken because that is fairly well-settled by a catena of decisions of this Court, vide decisions based on an interpretation of S. 190 of the Code. Also in Kishun Singh v. State of Bihar ( 1993 Indlaw SC 197 : )\\n24. This takes us to the next question : When can a Special Court be said to have been constituted ? The plain language of S. 36 says that the Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute as many Special Courts as may be necessary for such areas as may be specified in the notification. Therefore, the mode of constitution of Special Courts is by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazette specifying the area for which each Special Court is constituted. Sub-s. (2) of S. 36 states that the Special Court will be a Single Judge Court. Sub-s. (3) next provides that a person who has immediately before such appointment functioned as a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge shall be eligible to be appointed as a Judge of the Special Court.\\nSection 36, therefore, has two stages, namely, the first stage in regard to the constitution of Special Courts is by issuance of a notification in the Official Gazetted and then comes the appointment of the individual to function as a Judge of the Special Court. Therefore, as soon as the notification is issued under sub-s. (1) of S. 36 the process of constitution of a Special Court commences and it is only thereafter that the Government can seek the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court for the appointment of a Judge of that Court. As stated earlier, only a person who has worked as a Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge immediately before such appointment is qualified to be a Judge of the Special Court. This is the plain language of Section 36\\n25. But the question still survives whether the constitution of the Special Court can be said to be complete and effective only after the Judge to preside over the court is appointed ? The likelihood of a time-gap between the issuance of a notification under sub-s. (1) of S. 36 and the appointment of a Judge to man the court has to be countenanced. This is evident from the facts of this case which show that the notification under S. 36(1) was issued on 4-1-1991 and the notification appointing Shri Pathan to man one of the two courts was issued on 6-4-1991. Can the Special Court be said to have been constituted on 4-1-1991, or on 6-4-1991 ? Daud, J., opines that it could be said to have been constituted with effect from 6-4-1991. The learned counsel for the petitioner commends the view of Daud, J. for acceptance.\\nThe Division Bench, as pointed out earlier, disagreed with Daud, J. on the erroneous view that Daud, J. had omitted to notice the deeming provision in Section 36-D(1) when there is no such deeming provision in that sub-section or for that matter in Section 36-D. Secondly, reference to constitution of the Special Court in the real sense betrays confusion. Since Daud, J. has also not discussed this question in detail we may briefly deal with it\\n26. It is common knowledge that a \\'court\\' is an agency created by the sovereign for the purpose of administering justice. It is a place where justice is judicially administered. It is a legal entity. It is a Tribunal presided over by one or more Judges on whom are conferred certain judicial powers for administering justice in accordance with law. When a Judge takes his seat in court, the court is said to have assembled for administering justice. Thus the word \\'court\\' is a generic term and embraces a Judge but the vice versa is not true. Therefore, the words \\'court\\' and \\'Judge\\' are frequently used interchangeably because a Judge is an essential constituent of a court since there can be no dispensation of justice without a Judge. But that is not to say that when a Judge demits office the court ceases to exist. Bacon defines a court as:\\n\"an incorporeal being, which requires for its existence the presence of the Judge or a competent number of them, and a clerk or prothonotary, at or during which and at a place where it is by law authorised to be held\"\\nIn Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 21, we find the following statement:\\n\"A court cannot exist without a Judge, and the power to create a court embraces the power to create the office of Judge thereof\\nA court cannot be established until it has a judge, and unless the things required by the constitution for the existence of a court concur the court exist. The power to create a court ordinarily implies the power to create the office of judge thereof and to confer jurisdiction.\"\\n27. Since the authority to create courts is an attribute of sovereignty, the power can be exercised under the Constitution or under a constitutionally valid statute. The power to create courts carries with it the power to organise courts which would include the power to appoint the presiding officers for the courts. But as stated earlier while the words \\'court\\' and \\'Judge\\' are often used interchangeably they are not, strictly speaking, synonymous. The following observation illustrates the distinction\\n\"A \\'court\\' is an instrumentality of Government. It is a creation of the law, and in some respects it is an imaginary thing that exists only in legal contemplation, very similar to a corporation. A time when, a place where, and the persons by whom, judicial functions are to be exercised, are essential to complete the idea of a \\'court\\'. It is in its organized aspect, with all these constituent elements of time, place and officers, that completes the idea of a \\'court\\' in the general legal acceptation of the term. But a \\'court\\' may exist in legal contemplation without any officers charged with the duty of administering justice. The officers might all die or resign, and still the legal fiction would continue to exist. The judge of a court, while presiding over the court, is by common courtesy, called \\'the court\\', and the words \\'the court\\' and \\'the judge\\' or \\'judges\\' are frequently used in the status as synonymous, State ex rel Maer v. City of Cincinati (19 NE 2d 902 : 60 Ohio App 119).\"\\n28. Thus when complete in its organised aspect with all the constituent elements of time, place and officers, that \\'court\\' is constituted in the general legal acceptation of the term. This is true of the \\'initial\\' constitution only; thereafter the court will exist even if the court is without a Judge by reason of the Judicial Officer having vacated officer on resignation or retirement or removal or the like.\\nThe provision as to the constitution of the court at the \"initial stage\" as contemplated by Section 36, must, therefore, be understood to mean that all its constituent elements of time, place and officers are complete and unless the Judge expected to man the court is appointed the constitution cannot be said to be complete because the court cannot take off till then. The initial constitution becomes complete only when the requirements of both sub-s. (1) and (2) of S. 36 have been completed. For these reasons we are in agreement with the view expressed by Daud, J. in this behalf\\n29. But the main reason which motivated the Supreme Court Legal Aid Society to file this petition u/art. 32 of the Constitution was the delay in the disposal of cases under the Act involving foreigners. The reliefs claimed included a direction to treat further detention of foreigners, who were languishing in jails as undertrials under the Act for a period exceeding two years, as void or in any case they be released on bail and it was further submitted by counsel that their cases be given priority over others. When the petition came up for admission it was pointed out to counsel that such an invidious distinction between similarly situate undertrials who are citizens of this country and who are foreigners may not be permissible under the Constitution and even if priority is accorded to the cases of foreigners it may have the effect of foreigners being permitted to jump the queue and slide down cases of citizens even if their cases are old and pending since long. Counsel immediately realised that such a distinction if drawn would result in cases of Indian citizens being further delayed at the behest of foreigners, a procedure which may not be consistent with law.\\nHe, further, rightly sought permission to amend the cause- title and prayer clauses of the petition which was permitted. In substance the petitioner now prays that all undertrials who are in jail for the commission of any offence or offences under the Act for a period exceeding two years on account of the delay in the disposal of cases lodged against them should be forthwith released from jail declaring their further detention to be illegal and void and pending decision of this Court on the said larger issue, they should in any case be released on bail.\\n30. It is indeed true and that is obvious from the plain language of S. 36(1) of the Act, that the legislature contemplated the creation of Special Courts to speed up the trial of those prosecuted for the commission of any offence under the Act. It is equally true that similar is the objective of S. 309 of the Code. It is also true that this Court has emphasised in a series of decisions that Articles 14, 19 and 21 sustain and nourish each other and any law depriving a person of \"personal liberty\" must prescribe a procedure which is just, fair and reasonable, i.e., a procedure which promotes speedy trial. Hussainara Khatoon (IV) v. Home Secy. State of Bihar ( 1979 Indlaw SC 112 : 1979 Indlaw SC 112), Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar ( 1986 Indlaw SC 617 : 1986 Indlaw SC 617) and Kadra Pahadiya v. State of Bihar ( 1981 Indlaw SC 507 : 1981 Indlaw SC 507) to quote only a few. This is also the avowed objective of S. 36(1) of the Act.\\nHowever, this laudable objective got frustrated when the State Government delayed the constitution of sufficient number of Special Courts in Greater Bombay; the process of constituting the first two Special Courts started with the issuance of notifications under S. 36(1) on 4-1-1991 and under S. 36(2) on 6-4-1991 almost two years from 29-5-1989 when Amending Act 2 of 1989 became effective.\\n31. Since the number of courts constituted to try offences under the Act were not sufficient and the appointments of Judges to man these courts were delayed, cases piled up and the provision in regard to enlargement on bail being strict the offenders have had to languish in jails for want of trials. As stated earlier S. 37 of the Act makes every offence punishable under the Act cognizable and non-bailable and provides that no person accused of an offence punishable for a term of five years or more shall be released on bail unless\\n(i) the Public Prosecutor has had an opportunity to oppose bail and\\n(ii) if opposed, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of the offence and is not likely to indulge in similar activity. On account of the strict language of the said provision very few persons accused of certain offences under the Act could secure bail. Now to refuse bail on the one hand and to delay trial of cases on the other is clearly unfair and unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of S. 36(1) of the Act, S. 309 of the Code and Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. We are conscious of the statutory provision finding place in S. 37 of the Act prescribing the conditions which have to be satisfied before a person accused of an offence under the Act can be released. Indeed we have adverted to this section in the earlier part of the judgment.\\n32. We have also kept in mind the interpretation placed on a similar provision in S. 20 of the TADA Act by the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab ( 1994 Indlaw SC 525 : 1994 Indlaw SC 525). Despite this provision, we have directed as above mainly at the call of Art. 21 as the right to speedy trial may even require in some cases quashing of a criminal proceeding altogether, as held by a Constitution Bench of this Court in A. R. Antulay v. R. S. Nayak ( 1991 Indlaw SC 313 : 1991 Indlaw SC 313), release on bail, which can be taken to be embedded in the right of speedy trial, may, in some cases be the demand of Art. 21. As we have not felt inclined to accept the extreme submission of quashing the proceedings and setting free the accused whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time for reasons already alluded to, we have felt that deprivation of the personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial would also not be in consonance with the right guaranteed by Art. 21. Of course, some amount of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided in such cases; but if the period of deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, the fairness assured by Art. 21 would receive a jolt.\\nIt is because of this that we have felt that after accused persons have suffered imprisonment which is half of the maximum punishment provided for the offence, any further deprivation of personal liberty would be violative of the fundamental right visualised by Article 21, which has to be telescoped with the right guaranteed by Art. 14 which also promises justness, fairness and reasonableness in procedural matters. What then is the remedy ? The offences under the Act are grave and, therefore, we are not inclined to agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that we should quash the prosecutions and set free the accused persons whose trials are delayed beyond reasonable time. Alternatively he contended that such accused persons whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time and are likely to be further delayed should be released on bail on such terms as this Court considers appropriate to impose. This suggestion commends to us. We were told by the learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra that additional Special Courts have since been constituted but having regard to the large pendency of such cases in the State we are afraid this is not likely to make a significant dent in the huge pile of such cases.\\n33. We, therefore, direct as under(i) Where the undertrial is accused of an offence(s) under the Act prescribing a punishment of imprisonment of five years or less and find, such an undertrial shall be released on bail if he has been in jail for a period which is not less than half of the punishment provided for the offence with which he is charged and where he is charged with more than one offence, the offence providing the highest punishment. If the offence with which he is charged prescribes the maximum fine, the bail amount shall be 50% of the said amount with two sureties for like amount. If the maximum fine is not prescribed bail shall be to the satisfaction of the Special Judge concerned with two sureties for like amount\\n(ii) Where the undertrial accused is charged with an offence(s) under the Act providing for punishment exceeding five years and fine, such an undertrial shall be released on bail on the term set out in (i) above provided that his bail amount shall in no case be less than Rs. 50, 000 with two sureties for like amount\\n(iii) Where the undertrial accused is charged with an offence(s) under the Act punishable with minimum imprisonment of ten years and a minimum find of Rupees of one lakh, such an undertrial shall be released on bail if he has been in jail for not less than five years provided he furnishes bail in the sum of Rupees one lakh with two sureties for the like amount\\n(iv) Where an undertrial accused is charged for the commission of an offence punishable u/ss. 31 and 31-A of the Act, such an undertrial shall not be entitled to be released on bail by virtue of this order.\\n34. The directives in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall be subject to the following general conditions\\n(i) The undertrial accused entitled to be released on bail shall deposit his passport with the learned Judge of the Special Court concerned and if he does not hold a passport he shall file an affidavit to that effect in the form that may be prescribed by the learned Special Judge. In the latter case the learned Special Judge will, if he has reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement, write to the Passport Officer concerned to verify the statement and the Passport Officer shall verify his record and send a reply within three weeks. If he fails to reply with the said time, the learned Special Judge will be entitled to act on the statement of the undertrial accused;\\n(ii) the undertrial accused shall on being released on bail present himself at the police station which has prosecuted him at least once in a month in the case of those covered under clause (i), once in a fortnight in the case of those covered by cl. \\n(ii) and once in a week in the case of those covered by clause (iii), unless leave of absence is obtained in advance from the Special Judge concerned;\\n(iii) the benefit of the direction in cls. (ii) and (iii) shall not be available to those accused persons who are, in the opinion of the learned Special Judge, for reasons to be stated in writing, likely to temper with evidence or influence the prosecution witnesses;\\n(iv) in the case of undertrial accused who are foreigners, the Special Judge shall, besides impounding their passports, insist on a certificate of assurance from the Embassy/High Commission of the country to which the foreigner belongs, that the said accused shall not leave the country and shall appear before the Special Court as and when required;\\n(v) the undertrial accused shall not leave the area in relation to which the Special Court is constituted except with the permission of the learned Special Judge;\\n(vi) the undertrial accused may furnish bail by depositing cash equal to the bail amount;\\n(vii) the Special Judge will be at liberty to cancel bail if any of the above conditions are violated or a case for cancellation of bail is otherwise made out; and\\n(viii) after the release of the undertrial accused pursuant to this order, the cases of those undertrials who have not been released and are in jail will be accorded priority and the Special Court will proceed with them as provided in S. 309 of the Code.\\n35. We may state that the above are intended to operate as one-time directions for cases in which the accused persons are in jail and their trials are delayed. They are not intended to interfere with the Special Court\\'s power to grant bail under S. 37 of the Act. The Special Court will be free to exercise that power keeping in view the complaint of inordinate delay in the disposal of the pending cases. The Special Court will, notwithstanding the directions, be free to cancel bail if the accused is found to be misusing it and grounds for cancellation of bail exist. Lastly, we grant liberty to apply in case of any difficulty in the implementation of this order.\\n36. We are conscious of the fact that the menace of drug trafficking has to be controlled by providing stringent punishments and those who indulge in such nefarious activities do not deserve any sympathy. But at the same time we cannot be oblivious to the fact that many innocent persons may also be languishing in jails if we recall to mind the percentage of acquittals. Since harsh punishments have been provided for under the Act, the percentage of disposals on plea of guilt is bound to be small; the Stage Government should, therefore, have realised the need for setting up sufficient number of Special Courts immediately after the amendment of the Act by Amending Act 2 of 1989. Even after the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court refused to grant en bloc enlargement on bail on 1-2-1993 in Criminal Application No. 3480 of 1992 and B. D. Criminal No. 565 of 1992, no substantial improvement in the pendency is shown since new cases continue to pour in, and, therefore, a one-time exercise has become imperative to place the system on an even keel.\\nWe also recommend to the State Government to set up Review Committees headed by a Judicial Officer, preferably a retired High Court Judge, with one or two other members to review the cases of undertrials who have been in jail for long including those released under this order and to recommend to the State Government which of the cases deserve withdrawal. The State Government can then advise the Public Prosecutor to move the court for withdrawal of such cases. This will not only help reduce the pendency but will also increase the credibility of the prosecuting agency. After giving effect to this order the Special Court may consider giving priority to cases of those undertrials who continue in jail despite this order on account of their inability to furnish bail.\\n37. We dispose of the petition insofar as it relates to the State of Maharashtra. But we are told that the situation is equally grave, with varying degrees, in certain other States like the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Orissa, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. We direct notices to issue to these States through their Chief Secretaries to furnish information in the pro forma appended hereto to enable this Court to decide if similar action is called for. The information must be furnished within 4 weeks duly verified to be correct by an officer of the Department concerned not below the rank of a Deputy Secretary.\\nName of State\\nPROFORMA\\nPetition disposed of.\\n\\n\\nDocument 3: K.I.

The writ petitions u/art. 32 of theConstitution and appeals by special leave are against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in writ appeals have a common set of facts as also law for consideration. These matters have been heard together and are disposed of by this common judgment.\\n2.  Hindustan Commercial Bank (\\'Hindustan\\' for short). The Bank of Cochin Ltd. (hereafter referred to as \\'Cochin Bank\\') and Lakshmi Commercial Bank (\\'Lakshmi\\' for short) were private banks. the Act on was initiated u/s. 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (\\'the Act\\' for short) for amalgamation of these three banks with Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and State Bank of India respectively in terms of separate schemes drawn under that provision of the Act. Amalgamation has been made. Pursuant to the schemes, 28 employees of Hindustan, 21 employees of Cochin Bank and 76 employees of Lakshmi were excluded from employment and their services were not taken over by the respective transferee banks. Some of these excluded employees of the Cochin Bank went before the Kerala High Court for relief u/art. 226 of theConstitution. A learned Single Judge gave them partial relief but on an appeal to the Division Bench by the transferee bank concerned the writ petitions have been dismissed. The civil appeals are against the decision of the Division Bench. The writ petitions directly filed before this Court are by some of the excluded employees of Hindustan and Lakshmi respectively.\\n3.  Though employees of the other two banks had not challenged the vires of s. 45 of the Act, on behalf of Lakshmi such a challenge has been made. Since the grounds of attack on this score did not Impress us at all, we do not propose to refer to that aspect of the submissions involving interpretation of Article 31-A, Art. 16 and Art. 21. It has often been said by this Court that Courts should not enter into constitutional issues and attempt interpretation of its provisions unless it is really necessary for disposal of the dispute. In our opinion, this group of cases can be disposed of without reference to question of vires of some part of s. 45 of the Act being examined. Counsel on behalf of the excluded employees have broadly contended that the draft schemes did not include any name of employees intended to be excluded; no opportunity of being heard was afforded to them before exclusion was ordered under the schemes and the authorities concerned have not acted fairly; they deny the allegation that any of them was responsible for ficticious, improper or non-business like advances of loan to parties thereby bringing conditions near about bankruptcy for the appropriate banking companies; many other employees against whom there were definite charges already pending enquiry or even orders of dismissal had been proposed have been taken over and retained in service of the transferee banks while these excluded employees without justification have been called upon to face this unfortunate situation.\\n4.  The transferee banks, the Reserve Bank of India (hereafter referred to as RBI for short) and the Union of India have appeared and filed affidavits in opposition. The Union of India has contended that the scheme in respect of each of the banks that has got amalgamated had been approved by it as required under the Act and since finality was attached to such schemes challenge was not open against the schemes particularly in view of the provisions contained in Art. 3 I-A of theConstitution. On behalf of the Reserve Bank of India, several contentions were raised by way of opposition and shortly stated these submissions are:-\\n(1) Law does not require that the draft scheme should contain the names of the employees to be excluded;\\n(2) The incorporation of the names finalised on the basis of scrutiny of the records before the schemes were placed before the RBI was sufficient compliance of the requirements of the law;\\n(3) The provisions of the Act did not confer any right on the employees of being heard;\\n(4) The scheme-making process was legislative in character and therefore did not come within the ambit of natural justice. Alternately the action not being judicial or quasi-judicial and at the most being administrative or executive was also not open to challenge on allegations of violation of rules of natural justice;\\n(5) moratorium under the statutory provisions could not be beyond six months and in view of the fact that the entire operation had to be finalised within a brief time frame, the requirement of an enquiry by notice to all the officers intended to be excluded could not have been intended to be implanted into the provisions of section 45; and\\n(6) Provision of compensation has been made for those who were excluded from the respective scheme. Each of the transferee banks generally adopted the stand taken by RBI.\\n5.  Before we proceed to examine the tenability of the several contentions and counter contentions advanced at the hearing, it is appropriate that we refer to the relevant provisions of the Act. The entire law applicable to the facts of these cases is to be found in Part Ill of the Act and in particular in s. 45. As far as relevant, that section provides:\\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Part or in any other law or any agreement or other instrument, for the time being in force. where it appears to the Reserve Bank that there is good reason so to do, the Reserve Bank may apply to the Central Government for an order of moratorium in respect of a banking company.\\n(2) The Central Government, after considering the application made by the Reserve Bank under sub-section (1), may make an order of moratorium staying the commencement or continuance of all actions and proceedings against the company for a fixed period of time on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit and proper and may from time to time extend the period so however that the total period of moratorium shall not exceed six months;\\n(3) ..................... ...................\\n(4) During the period of moratorium, if the Reserve Bank is satisfied that-\\n(a) in the public interest; or\\n(b) in the interests of the depositors; or\\n(c) in order to secure the proper management of the banking company; or\\n(d) in the interests of the banking system of the country as a whole,-it is necessary so to do, the Reserve Bank may prepare a scheme-\\n(i) for the reconstruction of the banking company, or\\n(ii) for the amalgamation of the banking company with any other banking institution (in this section referred to as \"the transferee bank\").\\n(5) The scheme aforesaid may contain provisions for all or any of the following matters, namely:-\\n(a)...............................................\\n(b)...............................................\\n(c)...............................................\\n(d)...............................................\\n(e)...............................................\\n(f)...............................................\\n(g)...............................................\\n(h)...............................................\\n(i) the continuance of the services of all the employees of the banking company (excepting such of them as not being workmen within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are specifically mentioned in the scheme) in the banking company itself on its reconstruction or, as the case may be, in the transferee bank at the same remuneration and on the same terms and conditions of service, which they were getting or, as the case may be, by which they were being governed, immediately before the date of the order of moratorium:\\nProvided.........................................\\n(j) notwithstanding anything contained in cl. (i) where any of the employees of the banking company not being workmen within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are specifically mentioned in the scheme under clause (i), or where any employees of the banking company have by notice in writing given to the banking company or, as the case may be, the transferee bank at any time before the expiry of one month next following the date on which the scheme is sanctioned by the Central Government, intimated their intention of not becoming employees of the banking company on its reconstruction or, as the case may be, of the transferee bank, the payment to such employees of compensation, if any, to which they are entitled under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and such pension, gratuity, provident fund and other retirement benefits ordinarily admissible to them under the rules or authorisations of the banking company immediately before the date of the order of moratorium:\\n(k)...............................................\\n(I) ..............................................\\n(6) (a) A copy of the scheme prepared by the Reserve Bank shall be sent in draft to the banking company and also to the transferee bank and any other banking company concerned in the amalgamation, for suggestions and objections, if any, within such period as the Reserve Bank may specify for this purpose;\\n(b) the Reserve Bank may make such modifications, if any, in the draft scheme as it may consider necessary in the light of the suggestions and objections received from the banking company and also from the transferee bank, and any other banking company concerned in the amalgamation and from any members, depositors or other creditors of each of those companies and the transferee bank.\\n(7) The scheme shall thereafter be placed before the Central Government for its sanction and the Centraly Government may sanction the scheme without any modifications or with such modifications as it may consider necessary; and the scheme as sanctioned by the Central Government may specify in this behalf:\\nProvided .........................................\\n(7A) The sanction accorded by the Central Government under sub-section (7), whether before or after the commencement of s. 21 of the Banking Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963, shall be conclusive evidence that all the requirements of this section relating to reconstruction, or, as the case may be, amalgamation have been com plied with and a copy of the sanctioned scheme certified in writing by an officer of the Central Government to be a true copy thereof, shall, in all legal proceedings (whether in appeal or otherwise and whether instituted before or after the commencement of the said section 21), be admitted as evidence to the same extent as the original scheme.\\n(8) on and from the date of the coming into operation of the scheme or any provision thereof, the scheme or such provision shall be binding on the banking company or, as the case may be, on the transferee bank and any other banking company concerned in the amalgamation and also on all the members, depositors and other creditors and employees of each of those companies and of the transferee bank, and on any other person having any right or liability in relation to any of those companies or the transferee bank.............\\n(9)...............................................\\n(10) If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of the scheme, the Central Government may by order do anything not inconsistent with such provisions which appear to it necessary or expedient for the purpose of removing the difficulty.\\n(11) Copies of the scheme or of any order made under sub-section ( 10) shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, as soon as may be, after the scheme has been sanctioned by the Central Government or, as the case may be, the order has been made.\\n(12)..............................................\\n(13)..............................................\\n(14)..............................................\\n(15)..............................................\"\\n6.  Allegations advanced on behalf of the excluded employees is that the draft scheme contemplated under sub-s. 6(a) did not specifically mention names of the excluded employees and at a later stage when the scheme was sent up by the RBI to the Central Government a schedule containing the names of the excluded employees was attached to each of the schemes. S. 45 of  the Act provides a legislative scheme and the different steps required to be taken under this section have been put one after the other. A reading of this section indicates a sequence oriented pattern. What would ordinarily be incorporated in the draft scheme is indicated in sub- s. (5). After the requirements of sub-s. (5) are complied with and the scheme comes to a presentable shape, sub-s. (6)(a) requires a copy thereof as prepared by RBI to be sent to the banking company (transferer) as also to the transferer bank. Cl. (b) of sub-s. (6) authorises RBI to make modifications in the draft scheme as it may consider necessary in the light of suggestions and objections received from the banking company and the transferee bank. On a simple construction of sub-ss. (5) and (6) and on the basis of the sequence pattern adopted in s. 45 it would be legitimate to hold that the Act contemplates the employees to be excluded to be specifically named in the draft scheme.\\n7. Since it is a draft scheme prepared by RBI and the right to object or to make suggestions is extended to both the banking company as also the transferee bank, and in view of the fact that cl. (i) of sub-s. (5) specifies this item to be a matter which may be included in the scheme, it must follow that the legislative intention is that the scheme would incorporate the names of such employees as are intended to be excluded in accordance with the scheme. Once it is incorporated in the scheme the banking company as also the transferee bank would be entitled to suggest/object to the inclusion of names of employees. It may be that the names of some of the employees may have been wrongly included and the banking company-the hither-to employer would be in a position to suggest/object to the inclusion of the names or it may even be that names of some undesirable employees which should have been left out have been omitted and the banking company as the extant employer of such employees would be most competent to deal with such a situation to bring about rectifications by exercising the power to suggest/object to the draft scheme. The contention advanced on behalf of RBI that since it is open to it under sub-s. (6)(b) of s. 45 to make modifications of the draft scheme, even if the names were not included earlier, at the stage of finalising the scheme for placing it before the Central Government as required under sub-section (7), the earlier non-inclusion is not a contravention is not acceptable. We are of the view that in case some employees of the banking company are intended to be excluded, their names have to be specifically mentioned in the scheme at the draft stage. The requirement of specific mention is significant and the legislature must be taken to have intended compliance of the requirement at that stage. Mr. Salve for the RBI adopted the stand that the provisions of s. 45 did not specifically concede a right of objection or making of suggestions to employees and in sub-s. (6)(b) mention was made only of members, depositors or other creditors. For the reasons we have indicated above, this aspect of the contention does not impress us.\\n8.  It is the common case of RBI as also the transferee banks that the records of service of each of the employees had been scrutinised and the names for inclusion in the scheme were picked up on the basis of materials like irresponsible action in regard to sanction of loans and accommodations to customers which affected the financial stability of the banking company concerned. Such an allegation made in the counter-affidavit in this Court has been seriously disputed by the litigating excluded employees. It is their positive case that there was no foundation in such allegation and dubious loans, if any, had been sanctioned under instructions of the superior in the banking company and, therefore, did not involve any delinquency on the part of such employees. Since it is the case of the respondents that exclusion had been ordered on the basis of an objective assessment and the very A foundation of the allegation upon which such assessment has been made is disputed, a situation arose where facts had to be ascertained, and it involved assessment. That has admittedly not been done.\\n9. These employees were in employment under contract in the banking companies which were private banks. They have been excluded from service under the transferee banks and the contracts have now been terminated as a result of inclusion of their names in the schemes. It cannot be disputed-nay has not been-that exclusion has adversely affected this category of employees and has brought about prejudice and adverse civil consequences to them. Two contentions have been raised with reference to this aspect of the matter:-\\n(1) There has been infraction of natural justice and\\n(2) The transferee banks which are \\'State\\' and RBI which has monitored the operation being admittedly \\'State\\' their action in excluding some of the employees of the banking company and taking over the services of others who are similarly situated is hit by Art. 14 of theConstitution. It may be pointed out that according to the excluded employees, many facing similar allegations and/or in worse situation have been taken over.\\n10.  Whether there is infraction of Art. 14 of theConstitution on the allegation advanced would depend upon facts relating to the excluded employees as also the allegedly derelict employees whose services have been taken over. In the absence of an enquiry in which the excluded employees should have been given an opportunity of participation it has become difficult for us to probe into the matter further.\\n11.  Admittedly the excluded employees have neither been put to notice that their services were not being continued under the transferee banks nor had they been given an opportunity of being heard with reference to the allegations now levelled against them. Learned counsel for RBI and the transferee banks have taken the stand that the scheme-making process u/s. 45 is legislative in character and, therefore, outside the purview of the ambit of natural justice under the protective umbrella whereof the need to put the excluded employees to notice or enquiry arose. It is well-settled that natural justice will not be employed in the exercise of legislative power and Mr. Salve has rightly relied upon a recent decision of this Court being Union of India and Anr. v. Cynamide India Ltd. & Anr., [ 1987] 2 SCC 720 1987 Indlaw SC 28421 in support of such a position. But is the scheme-making process legislative? Power has been conferred on the RBI in certain situations to take steps for applying to the Central Government for an order of moratorium and during the period of moratorium to propose either reconstruction or amalgamation of the banking company. A scheme for the purposes contemplated has to be framed by RBI and placed before the Central Government for sanction. Power has been vested in the Central Government in terms of what is ordinarily known as a Henery-8 clause for making orders for removal of difficulties. S. 45(11) requires that copies of the schemes as also such orders made by the Central Government are to be placed before both Houses of Parliament. We do not think this requirement makes the exercise in regard to schemes a legislative process.\\n12.  It is not necessary to go to any other authority as the very decision relied upon by Mr. Salve in the case of Cynamide India Ltd. 1987 Indlaw SC 28421 (supra) lays down the test. In paragraph 7 of the judgment it has been indicated:-\\n\"Any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions, it has been said, is \\'difficult in theory and impossible in practice\\'. Though difficult, it is necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different legal rights and consequences may ensue. The distinction between the two has usually been expressed as \\'one between the general and the particular\\'. \\'A legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases; an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy\\'. \\'Legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future; administration is the process of performing particular acts, of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases\\'. It has also been said: \"Rule-making is normally directed towards the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class\" while, \"an adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific individuals or situations. But this is only a broad distinction, not necessarily always true.\"\\n13. Applying these tests it is difficult to accept Mr. Salve\\'s contention that the framing of the scheme u/s. 45 involves a legislative process. There are similar statutory provisions which require placing of material before the two Houses of Parliament yet not involving any legislative activity. The fact that orders made by the Central Government for removing difficulties as contemplated under sub-cl. (10) are also to be placed before the two Houses of Parliament makes it abundantly clear that the placing of the scheme before the two Houses is not a relevant test for making the scheme framing process legislative. We accordingly hold that there is no force in the contention of Mr. Salve that the process being legislative, rules of natural justice were not applicable.\\n14.  The alternate contention on this score is that the scheme-making process being an executive activity or alternately an administrative matter, rules of natural justice have no application. This contention has again to be rejected. Neither in \"Privy Council, Natural Justice and Certiorari\" has indicated:-\\n\"Formerly the presumption had been that there was obligation to give a hearing unless the statute itself indicated such an obligation; now the presumption is that there is such an obligation unless the statute clearly excludes it, notwithstanding the vesting of a power, in subjective terms, in a minister responsible to Parliament.\"\\n15.  As has beer. pointed out by Wells J. in Perre Brothers v. Citrus organisation Committee, [1975] 10 SASR 555:-\\n\"It is now well established-and there is no need for me to canvass the innumerable authorities bearing on this point-that duties, responsibilities and functions of an administrative authority may be purely ministerial, or they may embody some quasi or semi-judicial characteristic. At one time a good deal of ingenuity-and with all respect it seems to me a great deal of energy- was wasted in attempting to discern whether a particular function was administrative or quasi- judicial. In my view the House of Lords, and now the High Court, have, to a very large extent set all such controversies at rest. In my opinion, the test now is not so much as to whether one can fairly call something \"ministerial\" or \"administrative\", or \"quasi-judicial\" but whether the duties of a non-judicial authority must, having regard to the wording of the the Act, be carried out in a spirit of judicial fairness. \"\\n16.  In Re (H) K (an infant), [1967] 1 AER 226 Lord Parker, CJ, found that the immigration officer was not acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. Yet, the learned Chief Justice held that he still had to act fairly. In that case it meant giving K an opportunity of satisfying the officer as to his age, and for that purpose he had to let K know what his immediate impression was so that K could disabuse him of it. Lord Parker observed:-\\n\"I appreciate that in saying that, it may be said that one is going further than is permitted on the decided cases because heretofore at any rate the decisions of the courts do seem to have drawn a strict line in these matters according to whether there is or is not a duty to act judicially or quasi-judicially\".\\n17.  The obligation to act fairly even in administrative decision making has since been widely followed.\\nMulla in \\'Fairness: The New Natural Justice\\' has stated:-\\n\"Natural justice co-exists with, or reflected, a wider principle of fairness in decision-making and that all judicial and administrative decision-making and that all judicial and administrative decision-makers had a duty to act fairly.\"\\n18.  In the case of State of Horsily v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei & ors., [ 1967] 2 SCR 625 1967 Indlaw SC 144 this Court observed:-\\n\"It is true that the order is administrative in character but even an administrative order which involves civil consequences as already stated, must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice after informing the first respondent of the case of the State, the evidence in support thereof and after giving an opportunity to the first respondent of being heard and meeting or explaining the evidence. No such steps were admittedly taken; the High Court was, in our judgment, right in setting aside the order of the State.\"\\n19.  ln A.K Kraipak & ors. v. Union of India & ors., [ 1970] 1 SCR 457 1969 Indlaw SC 271 a Constitution Bench quoted with approval the observations of Lord Parker in Re: (H) K (an infant) (supra). Hegde, J. speaking for the Court stated:\\n\"Very soon thereafter a third rule was envisaged and that is that quasi-judicial enquiries must be held in good faith, without bias and not arbitrarily or unreasonablly. But in the course of years many more subsidiary rules came to be added to the rules of natural justice. Till very recently it was the opinion of the courts that unless the authority concerned was required by the law under which it functioned to act judicially there was no room for the application of the rules of natural justice. The validity of that limitation is now questioned. If the purpose of the rules of natural justice is to prevent miscarriage of justice one fails to see why those rules should be made inapplicable to administrative enquiries. Often times it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi-judicial enquiries. Enquiries which were considered administrative at one time are now being considered as quasi-judicial in character. Arriving at a just decision is the aim of both quasi-judicial enquiries as well as administrative enquiries. An unjust decision in an administrative enquiry may have more far reaching effect than a decision in a quasi-judicial enquiry.\"\\n20.  These observations in A.K. Kopak\\'s 1969 Indlaw SC 271 (supra) case were followed by another Constitution Bench of this Court in Chandra Bhavan Boarding and Lodging, Bangalore v. The State of Mysore & Anr., l 19701 2 SCR 600 1969 Indlaw SC 32. In Swadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India, [1981] 2 SCR 533 1981 Indlaw SC 349 a three-Judge Bench of this Court examined this aspect of natural justice. Sarkaria, J. who spoke for the Court, stated:-\\n\"During the last two decades, the concept of natural justice has made great strides in the realm of administrative law. Before the epoch- making decision of the House of Lords in Ridge v. Baldwin, it was generally thought that the rules of natural justice apply only to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; and for the purpose, whenever a breach of the rule of natural justice was alleged, Courts in England used to ascertain whether the impugned action was taken by the statutory authority or tribunal in the exercise of its administrative or quasi-judicial power. In India also, this was the position before the decision of this Court in Dr. Bina Pani Dei\\'s case 1967 Indlaw SC 144 (supra); wherein it was held that even an administrative order or decision in matters involving civil consequences, has to be made consistently with the rules of natural justice. This supposed distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative decisions, which was perceptibly mitigated in Bina Pani Dei\\'s case 1967 Indlaw SC 144 (supra) was further rubbed out to a vanishing point in A.K. Kraipak\\'s case 1969 Indlaw SC 271 (supra) ......................... \".\\n21.  On the basis of these authorities it must be held that even when a State agency acts administratively, rules of natural justice would apply. As stated, natural justice generally requires that persons liable to be directly affected by proposed administrative acts, decisions or proceedings be given adequate notice of what is proposed so that they may be in a position (a) to make representations on their own behalf; (b) or to appear at a hearing or-enquiry (if one is held); and (c) effectively to prepare their own case and to answer the case (if any) they have to meet.\\n22.  Natural justice has various facets and acting fairly is one of them. RBI which monitored the three amalgamations was required to act fairly in the facts of the case. The situation necessitated a participatory enquiry in regard to the excluded employees. Since the decision to exclude them from service under the transferee banks is grounded upon a set of facts the correctness whereof they deny, if an opportunity to know the allegations and to have their say had been afforded, they could have no grievance on this score. The action deprives them of their livelihood and brings adverse civil consequences and could obviously not be taken on the ipse dixit of RBI officers without verification of facts. It is quite possible that a maneuvering officer of the banking company adversely disposed of towards a particular employee of such bank could make a report against such employee and have him excluded from further service under the transferee bank. The possibility of exclusion on the basis of some mistake such as to identity cannot also be ruled out. There is all the more apprehension of this type is the process has to be completed quickly and very often the records of a large number of employees have to be scrutinised. We are of the view that rules of natural justice apply to administrative action and in the instant cases the decision to exclude a section of the employees without complying with requirements of natural justice was bad.\\n23.  It has been contended on behalf of respondents that moratorium could be for a total period of six months and that was the time allowed for the entire operation to be conducted. In view of the time frame, by necessary implication it must follow that application of natural justice compliance of which would involve a time-consuming process was ruled out. We do not think that there is any merit in this contention either. As a fact, in respect of the three banks the total number of excluded employees is around 125. It is the common case of parties that proceedings were pending against some of them. It may be that in view of the time frame a detailed enquiry involving communication of allegations, show cause, opportunity to lead evidence in support of the allegations and in defence of the stand of the employees may not be possible. Keeping the legislative scheme in view perhaps a simpler enquiry, for instance, communication of the allegation and even receiving an explanation and in cases where the allegation was serious or there was a total denial though there was firm basis for the allegation a single personal hearing could be afforded. In this case we are not really concerned with the manner or extent of hearing as there has been no hearing at all. It must, therefore, be held that the action of excluding these employees in the manner done cannot be supported.\\n24.  Fair play is a part of the public policy and is a guarantee for justice to citizens. In our system of Rule of Law every social agency conferred with power is required to act fairly so that social action would be just and there would be furtherance of the well-being of citizens. The rules of natural justice have developed with the growth of civilisation and the content thereof is often considered as a proper measure of the level of civilisation and Rule of Law prevailing in the community. Man within the social frame has struggled for centuries to bring into the community the concept of fairness and it has taken scores of years for the rules of natural justice to conceptually enter into the field of social activities. We do not think in the facts of the case there is any justification to hold that rules of natural justice have been ousted by necessary implication on account of the time frame. On the other hand we are of the view that the time limited by statute provides scope for an opportunity to be extended to the intended excluded employees before the scheme is finalised so that a hearing commensurate to the situation is afforded before a section of the employees is thrown out of employment.\\n\"We may now point out that the learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court had proposed a post-amalgamation hearing to meet the situation but that has been vacated by the Division Bench. For the reasons we have indicated, there is no justification to think of a post-decisional heading. On the other hand the normal rule should apply. It was also contended on behalf of the respondents that the excluded employees could now represent and their cases could be examined. We do not think that would meet the ends of justice. They have already been thrown out of employment and having been deprived of livelihood they must be facing serious difficulties. There is no justification to throw them out of employment and then given them an opportunity of representation when the requirement is that they should have the opportunity referred to above as a condition precedent to action. It is common experience that once a decision has been taken, there is a tendency to uphold it and a representation may not really yield any fruitful purpose.\\n\\'Amalgamation\\' as such saved under Article 31A(1)(c) of theConstitution is not under challenge here. Strong reliance, however, had been placed on the provisions of sub- section (7A) of s. 45 of the Act. The relevant part of it is as requoted here for convenience:-\"\\n25.  The sanction accorded by the Central Government under sub-s. (7) .. shall be conclusive evidence that all the requirements of this section relating to ............ amalgamation have been complied-with\\n26.  This provision is indeed one for purposes of evidence. In Smt. Somavanti & ors. v. State of Punjab & Ors., [19631 2 SCR 774 1962 Indlaw SC 405 this Court pointed out that there was no real difference between \\'conclusive proof\\' provided for in s. 4 of the Evidence Act and \\'conclusive evidence\\' as appearing in sub-section (7A). This provision does not bar the raising of a dispute of the nature received here. As we have already pointed out, amalgamation is not under challenge. Parties are disputing as to what exactly are the requirements of the procedure laid down underthe Act and the position that no opportunity was afforded to the excluded employees is not in dispute. To a situation as here protection of the umbrella of conclusive evidence is not attached so as to bar the question from being examined. There is, therefore, nothing in sub-section (7A) to preclude examination of the question canvassed here\\n27.  The writ petitions and the appeals must succeed. We set aside the impugned judgments of the Single Judge and Division Bench of the Kerala High Court and direct that each of the three transferee banks should take over the excluded employees on the same terms and conditions of employment under the respective banking companies prior to moratorium. The employee would be entitled to the benefit of continuity of service for all purposes including salary and perks throughout the period. We leave it open to the transferee banks to take such action as they consider proper against these employees in accordance with law. Some of the excluded employees have not come to Court. There is no justification to penalise them for not having litigated. They too shall be entitled to the same benefits as the petitioners. Ordinarily the successful parties should have been entitled to costs but in view of the fact that they are going back to employment, we do not propose to make orders of costs against their employers.\\n28. We hope and trust that the transferee banks would look at the matter with an open mind and would keep themselves alive to the human problem involved in it.\\nPetitions and Appeals allowed.\\nAppeals allowed.\\n\\n\\n'"

      "Appeal (civil) 3137 of 1999\n",
      "The Judgment was delivered by: S. B. Sinha, J.\n",
      "1.  The appellant herein was respondent No. 8 in one of the public interest litigations being No. 6240 of 1997 which was disposed of along with another public interest litigation being No. 5717 of 1997 and Contempt Case No. 779 of 1997.\n",
      "2.  The appellant herein has not questioned the correctness or otherwise of the impugned judgment dated 6th July, 1998 passed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the aforementioned matters but only is concerned with certain observations made therein as also imposition of a sum of Rs. 20,000/- by way of costs. These two public interest litigations were filed successively by one B. Kistaiah, said to be a former Member of Legislative Assembly and the Writ Petition No. 6240 of 1997 by Digumarthi Premchand, said to be a journalist. In the said purported public interest litigations alleged malfunctioning of the Commissioner of Central Excise resulting in loss of several crores of rupees as also purported dismantling of the Special Investigating Team headed by the appellant herein were in question.\n",
      "3.  The writ petitioners contended that the said Special Investigation Team was dismantled by the Commissioner-I Central Excise & Customs, Hyderabad Commissioner ate only with a view to help the dishonest traders and to prevent the cases relating to evasion of excise duty. The appellant was not initially a party therein but despite the same an order of transfer passed against him and others dated 10.3.1997 bearing Establishment Order (G.O.) No. 43/97 was questioned in the said writ petition. The cause of action for filing writ petition No. 5717 of 1997 was also said to be issuance of the said order of transfer dated 10.3.1997. A Division Bench of the High Court by an order dated 21.03.1997 directed the appellant (although thence he was not a party) not to hand over any record in any pending case which was or is under his investigation to M.V.S. Chowdary till 26.3.1997.\n",
      "4. The respondents were also purported to be relying on or on the basis of the additional affidavit directed by the High Court to file their counter-affidavits and produce the records relating to setting up of the Special Investigation Team and its disbanding. The writ petitioner, however, instructed his counsel to withdraw the writ petition stating:\n",
      "\"My conscience, however, does not permit me to proceed with the said writ petition. I am also uncertain of the effect of the matter will have and I am constrained, for my personal reasons, and for my personal safety to seek the permission of the Hon'ble Court to withdraw the writ petition.\"\n",
      "5.  When the said matter was pending, another writ petition marked as W.P. No. 6240 of 1997 came to be filed by Digumarthi Premchand wherein the averments made, except for one paragraph were verbatim the same of those contained in writ petition bearing No. 5717 of 1997. In the said writ petition also the appellant herein was impleaded as a party and the main attack therein was directed against the said proceedings dated 10.03.1997 transferring the appellant.\n",
      "6.  It appears that the Director General, NACEN and Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad by an order dated 08.05.1997 directed that the appellant should be taken back on the rolls of Hyderabad Commissioner ate and furthermore should be handed over the cases for investigation. A further direction was made to examine how his period of absence can be regularised. The writ petitioner filed an application dated 22.5.1997 for implementation of the said proceedings which was marked as WPMP (SR) No. 55758 of 1997. Surprisingly enough, they said application was purported to have been directed to be placed for House Motion before a Division Bench purported to be under the orders of the Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which admittedly was found to be wrong.\n",
      "7. The appellant herein filed two applications on the same day one, to implead him as one of the respondents and the other to give effect to the said proceedings dated 8.5.1997 issued by the Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad. Despite the fact that the Registry of the High Court was not supposed to receive the said applications without the order of the Hon'ble Chief Justice, the same was done on a wrong premise that a direction in that behalf had been issued by the Chief Justice. Interestingly, the writ petitioner informed the Registrar (Judicial) that he would not be insisting for House Motion as his advocate would not be available but keeping in view the purported order passed by the Chief Justice, a Bench was constituted in relation where to admittedly no direction had been issued by the Chief Justice. It also stands admitted that even no direction had been issued to number the said applications, whence the application filed by the appellants were placed before the Bench.\n",
      "8.  The Registry submitted several reports before the Court, on having been asked to do so, which reveal as to how a fraud was practised upon the court presumably in collusion with some officers of the Registry. A contempt proceeding was initiated against Digumarthi Premchand relying or on the basis of the said reports but as the writ petitioner had been evading service of notice, not only non-bailable warrant was issued in absence of any correct address of writ petitioner having been furnished; the CBI was also asked to cause to make a detailed enquiry/investigation into the following issues:\n",
      "\"(a) whether there is any person by name Digumarthi Premchand, Journalist, r/o. Narayanaguda and if such a person is available, cause his production before this Court on or before 19-9-1997, (b) if there is no such person by name Digumarthi Premchand, the sixth respondent shall investigate and find out as to under what circumstances this writ petition came into existence and the person or persons responsible for filing the same.\"\n",
      "9.  Upon making an enquiry into the matter, a report was filed by the CBI on 19.9.1997 before the division bench of the High Court. The appellant herein thereafter appeared before the Court on 17.10.1997. The CBI submitted a final report stating that a chargesheet under Section 120-B read with Sections 199, 200, 201, 416, 465 and 471 of Indian Penal Code and Ss. 109 thereof had been filed by it against the writ petitioner, the appellant herein and one M. Kali Prasada who is his close relative. The material portions of the said report read as under:\n",
      "\"On 17-3-1997 Sri N. K. Prasada met one Sri B. Kistaiah an Ex. MLA who had got close association with Sri B. P. Agarwal Textile Mill owner of Shadnagar with whom they said Sri N. K. Prasada also had acquaintance. On the same day Sri Kistaiah filed a WP No.5717 of 1997 alleging irregularities in Customs and Central Excise, Hyderabad and also filed several documents along with writ petition which were supplied by N. K. Prasada. Not contended with filing of the above writ petition Sri N. K. Prasada A2 also got filed another WP No.6240 of 1997 through Sri S. Ramachandra Rao, senior Advocate and Seshagiri Rao, Advocate. Since, the subject-matter of both the writ petitions are one and the same, the Hon'ble High Court posted the matter for hearing before Hon'ble Justice V. Bhaskar Rao and Hon'ble Justice Sri B. Sudarshan Reddy. Sri Padmanabham, clerk of Sri Ramachander Rao informed that on 22-5-1997 Sri N.K. Prasada came to the office of Sri Ramachander Rao and asked him for the house motion petition of D. Premchand and Sri Padmanabham showed him the bundle from which Sri N. K. Prasada took out the petition informing him that he is taking the house motion petition of D. Premchand. Sri N. K. Prasada, (A2) has obtained this writ petition back from the Registrar of the High Court since some objections were raised by the Registrar and Sri N. K. Prasada also signed in return register maintained by the Registrar office in token of receipt of the petition back.\n",
      "The register as well as specimen signatures of Sri N. K. Prasada have been referred to GEQD who opined that the signatures on the register pertains to Sri N. K. Prasada. The investigation disclosed that the origin of all Phonogram was from public telephone booth bearing No. 243 980, located at Basheerbagh and other PCO telephone No.332917 located at Erramanzil Colony. Investigation disclosed that on the day of filing of WP No.6240 of 1997 i.e., 26-3-1997 Sri Kali Prasada was taken to the office of Sri S. Ramachander Rao by Sri N.K. Pramda and Sri B. P. Agarwal. Investigation also disclosed that on 26-3-1997, Sri D. Premchand was present at Srikakulam and he has not come to Hyderabad nor he signed the affidavit enclose with the WP No.6240 of 1997. The GEQD has opined that the signature on WP No.6240 of 1997 was not that of Sri D. Premchand. But Sri D. Premchand with a fraudulent and dishonest intention filed an affidavit before the Hon'ble High Court on 7-11-1997 stating that he himself has signed the affidavit enclosed with the WP No.6240 of 1997 and that he himself filed the petition. Sri S. Ramachander Rao, Sr. Advocate and Sri Seshagiri Rao, Advocate who filed the WP No.6240 of 1997 have also stated in their statements recorded u/s. 164 Cr.P.C before the II MM Hyderabad that the person Sri D. Premchand who had surrendered before Hon'ble High Court on 19-9-1997 was not the person who came along with Sri N. K. Prasada and who signed the WP No.6240 of 1997 on 26-3-1997.\n",
      "The document filed along with WP No.5717 of 1997 of Sri B. Kistaiah, Ex.MLA, Shadnagar were supplied by Sri N. K. Prasada has stated by Sri K. R. Prabhakar Rao, Advocate for Sri B. Kistaiah, Sri B. Kistaiah also stated before the Hon'ble High Court that Sri N. K. Prasada requested him not to withdraw the petition. By the aforesaid acts all the accused entered into criminal conspiracy and fraudulently filed WP No.6240 of 1997 and in which process A3 impersonated A1 under the active connivance of A2 and thereby played fraud on the higher judiciary. A1 has falsely stated through an affidavit before the Hon'ble High Court of A.P. on 7-11-1997 that he himself filed WP No.6240 of 1997.\n",
      "Thus, all the three accused i.e., A1 to A3 committed offences punishable under Section 120-B read with 199, 200, 201, 419, 465 and 471 IPC and S. 109 IPC.\n",
      "It is therefore prayed that the Hon'ble Court may take cognizance of the case against the accused and they may be dealt with according to law. Hence the charge-sheet.\"\n",
      "10.  The CBI was also directed by the High Court by an order dated 19.9.1997 to make investigation into the question as to:\n",
      "\"(1) whether the petitioner, himself, got the information required for the purpose of filing this writ petition and if so, who are the persons from whom the petitioner had gathered the information. It is also just and necessary to find out as to (2) how and on what basis the averments in the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition are made and the persons responsible for making or engineering the averments made in the affidavit.\"\n",
      "11.  A direction was also issued to find out as to under what circumstances the writ petitioner proposed to withdraw the writ petition as also who were the person's redsponsible for getting the letter of withdrawal filed by the writ petitioner. The CBI in its report inter alia opined that the appellant herein was the person working behind the scene. Interestingly, during the said investigation the appellant could not be traced out. The aforementioned B. Kistaiah (writ petitioner in W.P. No.6240 of 1997) made a solemn statement before the High Court wherein also he named the appellant herein as a person who was responsible for getting the writ petition filed through the advocate although he did not know him personally. He further alleged that the requisite documents for filing the writ petition have been handed over to the learned Advocate by the appellant.\n",
      "12. The High Court upon analysis of the pleadings and other materials placed before it noticed:\n",
      "\"On analysis of the pleadings before us and various reports filed by the CBI and the sworn statement of the petitioner in WP No.5717 of 1997 would lead to an irresistible conclusion that both these writ petitions are engineered and brought into existence by the 8th respondent herein with an oblique motive of avoiding an order of simple transfer dated 8-5-1997. It is the 8th respondent who has acted from behind the scene and had set up the petitioner to file the writ petition making reckless and unfounded allegations against the respondents. All this has been done only to avoid an order of simple transfer. To what extent the 8th respondent can stoop down is amply demonstrated from the contents of his own affidavit filed into this Court. In one of his counter-affidavits to the report of the CBI dated 17-10-1997 the 8th respondent inter alia states that \"on the day Sri B. P. Agarwal introduced me to the advocate but I had met Sri S. Ramachandra Rao later on my own to seek advice whether I should file in CAT or in High Court. As per his directions, I had given him relevant papers which he said he would examine and advise me accordingly.\n",
      "However, without my knowledge or authorisation he used the documents to file a Public Interest Litigation. I came to know much later that the Hon'ble High Court has issued certain directions on the PIL filed by B. Kistaiah, At no point of time did I influence or induce anyone to file a petition on my behalf.\"\n",
      "It is further stated that \"the role of Sri S. Ramachander Rao as a senior Advocate looks very dubious in this context. This is apart from misusing the documents given by me to him in good faith for filing my own petition. This is a clear case of breach of client's confidentiality and interest.\"\n",
      "It is now clear that it is the 8th respondent who made available the entire material filed into Court as material papers in these writ petitions. Obviously, the writ petition is drafted on the basis of the material supplied by the 8th respondent. It would be totally altogether a different matter as to whether the affidavit is signed by the petitioner or by somebody else at the instance of Respondent No.8. But the feet remains that material has been admittedly made available by the 8th respondent, undoubtedly he is the king pin in the whole drama and operating from behind the scene.\"\n",
      "13.  Before the High Court Shri E. Seshagiri Rao, advocate who had filed the writ petition affirmed an affidavit wherefrom it transpired that the writ petition had been filed from the Office of Shri S. Ramchander Rao, a senior advocate purported to be on the instructions of one Shri B. P. Agarwal, the appellant herein and some other persons.\n",
      "14.  The High Court noticed gross abuse of the process of the Court in the manner of filing the aforementioned two writ petitions said to be in the nature of public interest litigations. The High Court also went into the merit of the matter and arrived at a finding that the writ petitions were filed at the instance of the appellant herein. The High Court while finding the said writ petitions to be without any merit opined that no relief can be granted to the writ petitioner. The High Court also expressed its unhappiness over the role of the lawyers. The High Court although noticed that the writ petitioner in writ petition No. 5717 of 1997 appeared in person and wanted to withdraw the writ petition but did not absolve him of his responsibility in the matter in filing the writ petition at the instance of the appellant herein. However, it took a lenient view and dismissed the writ petition without awarding any cost against him. The High Court, however, administered severe warning to him to be careful in future and not to play any game with judicial process.\n",
      "15.  So far as writ petition No. 6240 of 1997 is concerned, the High Court held:\n",
      "\"So far as WP No.6240 of 1997 is concerned, we have already observed that the petitioner, as well as the 8th respondent are guilty of abuse of the judicial process in the name of public interest litigation. They have put the device of public interest litigation to naked abuse. The weapon invented by the Apex Court with a noble cause intended to serve the deprived sections of the Society pressed into operation for destructive purpose. The streams of justice are polluted by their conduct. We, under those circumstances, consider it appropriate to dismiss the writ petition-Writ Petition No.6240 of 1997 with exemplary costs quantified at Rs.25,000/-(Rupees twenty five thousand only); out of which a sum of Rs.5,000.00 (Rupees five thousand only) shall be paid by the petitioner, Digumarthi Premchand and the remaining sum of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees twenty thousand only) shall be paid by the respondent No. 8, N. K. Prasada. The amount shall be deposited by the petitioner and the 8th respondent with A.P. State Legal Services Authority.\"\n",
      "16.  In the contempt proceedings the writ petitioner was found guilty and punishment till the rising of the court was awarded to the writ petitioner. The High Court, however, keeping in view the pendency of the criminal case observed:\n",
      "\"However, we would like to make very clear that we have not expressed any opinion whatsoever with regard to the merits of the prosecution and the charge-sheet filed by the CBI against the petitioner as well as 8th respondent and one Kali Prasada. The trial Court shall proceed with the trial uninfluenced by any of the observations made by us in this order. We have not expressed any opinion about any of the aspects and merits of the allegations levelled against the petitioner and the 8th respondent. The observations, if any, made by this Court while referring to the reports of the CBI and the charge-sheet are confined for the purpose of disposal of this writ petitions and the contempt case. The trial Court shall dispose of the criminal case uninfluenced by any observation whatsoever made in this case.\"\n",
      "17.  Contentions of Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant are two-fold. Firstly he drew our attention to a First Information Report purported to have been lodged by him against one T.N. Rao, Dy. S.P. CBI Hyderabad and urged that as the said officer had himself been facing a criminal charge of asking for bribe, his report filed before the High Court should not have been relied upon. The learned counsel would secondly urge that although the appellant was impleaded as a party, no opportunity of hearing having been granted to him the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.\n",
      "18.  Mr. Anoop G. Choudhary, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, would submit that the High Court itself could have been moved for expunction of the remarks by the appellant herein. It was pointed out that the appellant took part in the CBI enquiry, filed an application for regularisation of leave and keeping in view the report submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation, his involvement in getting the writ petition filed is apparent on the face of the record.\n",
      "19.  The writ petitioner who had been arrayed as respondent No. 8 in the Special Leave application has filed an affidavit. He in his affidavit does not deny or dispute the findings of the High Court. He does not say that the writ petition was not filed at the instance of the appellant herein. It is not in dispute that although the appellant was not a party in the writ petition the order of transfer passed against him dated 10.3.1997 was the subject matter thereof and an interim order had been passed by the Division Bench of the High Court. The fact that he derived benefit of the said interim order is not denied or disputed. The fact that he filed two applications, one for imp leading himself as a party in the pending writ proceeding and another for an interim order purported to be for implementing the order of the Chief Commissioner dated 08.05.1997 also stands admitted.\n",
      "20.  We may recall that the original writ petitioner also filed a similar application. The High Court arrived at its conclusion not only on the basis of the report of the Central Bureau of Investigation which, inter alia, contains the statements of the clerk of Shri S. Ramchandra Rao, Advocate and his involvement in filing the application and taking the same back from the Registry which is borne out of the return register maintained by the Registry but also the detailed reports submitted by the Registrar (Judicial) before the High Court from time to time as also other affidavits, sworn statements and other materials brought on record. As the finding of the High Court is to the effect that the appellant herein was the king pin of the entire episode and had engineered the entire game with a view to getting his order of transfer stayed is prima facie in nature, we do not find any reason to interfere therewith.\n",
      "21.  The writ petition and the contempt proceedings pending before the High Court were disposed of on the basis of the materials on record. The materials not only included affidavits of the parties as also that of the appellant but also the sworn statements of the writ petitioner and the Advocate appearing for the writ petitioner. In view of the fact that even the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner categorically stated that at the time of drawing of the writ petition the appellant was present, no fault with the findings of the High Court can be found out if reliance had been placed thereupon. The appellant had intervened in the writ applications as far back as on 22.5.1997. He, it will bear repetition to state, filed an application for grant of an interim relief. The same was pending and, thus, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever, having regard to the fact that the Central Bureau of Investigation was making enquiry; the appellant herein must be held to have been aware thereabout.\n",
      "22. His two applications were also pending and presumably pressed (as there is nothing on record to show that at any point of time, he intended to withdraw the same), and thus a presumption can be drawn to the effect that he/his advocate had been keeping a watch over the entire proceeding. Despite the same at no point of time the appellant wanted to cross-examine any witness. He never brought the fact to the notice of the court that a criminal case had also been filed against the Dy. S.P. of the C.B.I. allegedly for taking bribe. He allowed the proceedings before the High Court to go on. He sat on the fence. He, as has been noticed by the High Court, even could not be traced out for some time. Furthermore, he appeared to be on leave during the following period:\n",
      "\"1. 83 days EL from 3-4-1997 to 24-6-1997.\n",
      "2. 138 days EL from 26-6-1997 to 10-11-1997.\n",
      "3. 15 days EL from 11-11-1997 to 25-11-1997.\n",
      "4. 115 days Half-pay leave from 26-11-1997 to 29-4-1998.\n",
      "5. 32 days extraordinary leave from 30-4-1998 to 31-5-1998.\"\n",
      "23.  He, as noticed hereinbefore, filed application for regularisation of the said period of leave pursuant to or in furtherance of the observations made by the Chief Commissioner, Hyderabad in his order dated 08.05.1997.\n",
      "24.  The principles of natural justice, it is well-settled, cannot be put into a strait-jacket formula. Its application will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It is also well-settled that if a party after having proper notice chose not to appear, he a later stage cannot be permitted to say that he had not been given a fair opportunity of hearing. The question had been considered by a Bench of this Court in Sohan Lal Gupta (Dead) through LRs. and Others Vs. Asha Devi Gupta (Smt.) and Others [(2003) 7 SCC 492 2003 Indlaw SC 719] of which two of us (V.N. Khare, CJI and Sinha, J.) are parties wherein upon noticing a large number of decisions it was held:\n",
      "\"29.The principles of natural justice, it is trite, cannot be put in a straitjacket formula. In a given case the party should not only be required to show that he did not have a proper notice resulting in violation of principles of natural justice but also to show that he was seriously prejudiced thereby...\"\n",
      "25.  The principles of natural justice, it is well-settled, must not be stretched too far.\n",
      "26.  In any event, it is not a case where this Court should exercise its discretion in favour of the appellant. It is trite that in a given case, the Court may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction u/art. 136 of the Constitution. (See Chandra Singh and Others Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another [(2003) 6 SCC 545 2003 Indlaw SC 541] and State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Savinderjit Kaur [JT 2004 (3) SC 4702004 Indlaw SC 227]\n",
      "27.  The scope of public interest litigation has recently been noticed by this Court in Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and Another vs. C. K. Rajan and others [(2003) 7 SCC 546 2003 Indlaw SC 633] holding:\n",
      "\"...Statutory functions are assigned to the State by the Legislature and not by the Court. The Courts while exercising its jurisdiction ordinarily must remind itself about the doctrine of separation of powers which, however, although does not mean that the Court shall not step-in in any circumstance whatsoever but the Court while exercising its power must also remind itself about the rule of self-restraint. The Courts, as indicated hereinbefore, ordinarily is reluctant to assume the functions of the statutory functionaries. It allows them to perform their duties at the first instance.\n",
      "The court steps in by Mandamus when the State fails to perform its duty. It shall also step in when the discretion is exercised but the same has not been done legally and validly. It steps in by way of a judicial review over the orders passed. Existence of alternative remedy albeit is no bar to exercise jurisdiction u/art. 226 of the Constitution of India but ordinarily it will not do so unless it is found that an order has been passed wholly without jurisdiction or contradictory to the Constitutional or statutory provisions or where an order has been passed without complying with the principles of natural justice. (See Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others (1998) 8 SCC 1 1998 Indlaw SC 13).\n",
      "It is trite that only because floodgates of cases will be opened, by itself may not be no ground to close the doors of courts of justice. The doors of the courts must be kept open but the Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground realities while entertaining a public interest litigation.\n",
      "Exercise of self-restraint, thus, should be adhered to, subject of course to, just exceptions.\"\n",
      "(See also Maharashtra State Board of Secondary Education Vs. Paritosh Bhupesh Kumarsheth etc., AIR 1984 SC 1543 1984 Indlaw SC 322.)\n",
      "28.  The said decision has been followed in Chairman & MD, BPL Ltd. vs. S.P. Gururaja and Others [(2003) 8 SCC 567 2003 Indlaw SC 860], wherein it was noticed:\n",
      "\"Dawn Oliver in Constitutional Reform in the UK under the heading 'The Courts and Theories of Democracy, Citizenship, and Good Governance' at page 105 states:\n",
      "\"However, this concept of democracy as rights-based with limited governmental power, and in particular of the role of the courts in a democracy, carries high risks for the judges-and for the public. Courts may interfere in advisedly in public administration. The case of Bromley London Borough Council v. Greater London Council ([1983] 1 A.C. 768 , HL) is a classic example. The House of Lords quashed the GLC cheap fares policy as being based on a misreading of the statutory provisions, but were accused of themselves misunderstanding transport policy in so doing. The courts are not experts in policy and public administration-Jowell's point that the courts should not step beyond their institutional capacity (Jowell, 2000). Acceptance of this approach is reflected in the judgments of Laws LJ in International Transport Roth GmbH Vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department ([2002] EWCA Civ. 158 : [2002] 3 W.L.R. 344) and of Lord Nimmo Smith in Adams v. Lord Advocate (Court of Session, Times, 8 August 2002) in which a distinction was drawn between areas where the subject matter lies within the expertise of the courts (for instance, criminal justice, including sentencing and detention of individuals) and those which were more appropriate for decision by democratically elected and accountable bodies. If the courts step outside the area of their institutional competence, government may react by getting Parliament to legislate to oust the jurisdiction of the courts altogether. Such a step would undermine the rule of law. Government and public opinion may come to question the legitimacy of the judges exercising judicial review against Ministers and thus undermine the authority of the courts and the rule of law.\"\n",
      "In Onkarlal Bajaj and Others Vs. Union of India and Another [(2003) 2 SCC 673 2002 Indlaw SC 1577] it was observed:\n",
      "\"The expression 'public interest' or 'probity in governance', cannot be put in a straitjacket. 'Public interest' takes into its fold several factors. There cannot be any hard and fast rule to determine what is public interest the circumstances in each case would determine whether Government action was taken is in public interest or was taken to uphold probity in governance. The role model for governance and decision taken thereof should manifest equity, fair play and justice. The cardinal principle of governance in a civilized society based on rule of law not only has to base on transparency but must create an impression that the decision-making was motivated on the consideration of probity. The Government has to rise above the nexus of vested interests and nepotism and eschew window dressing. The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or capricious actions.\n",

      "Appeal (crl.) 924 of 2001\n",
      "The Judgment was delivered by : Arijit Pasayat, J.\n",
      "1.   The appellants were convicted for offences punishable u/s. 302 read with S. 34 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (in short the 'IPC') and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment by the Trial Court. They did not get any relief from the Allahabad High Court which by the impugned judgment upheld the conviction and sentence.\n",
      "The prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n",
      "2.   After death of Durga Singh, each of his three sons became owner of about 30 bighas of land. One of them, Khetrapal (hereinafter referred to as the 'deceased') was issueless. Earlier Khetrapal used to reside with accused Janak Singh and the latter used to cultivate the land which fell to share of Khetrapal also. But about a year or 1-1/2 years prior to the incident in question, Khetrapal started living with Bhuri Singh (PW-1). The land of Khetrapal Singh, which was earlier being cultivated by Janak Singh came into the possession of Bhuri Singh. This was to the disliking of accused Janak Singh. Khetrapal wanted to execute a will in favour of Bhuri Singh. On the date of incident, i.e. 16.10.1979 at about 10 a.m., Khetrapal along with Bhuri Singh (PW-1) and Surjeet Singh (PW-7) were proceeding to Etmadpur Tehsil for execution of the Will and when they reached near the pit, the accused Janak Singh armed with a country made pistol and accused Sarvesh with a gun arrived there and enquired from Khetrapal whether he was going to execute a will in favour of Bhuri Singh and when Khetrapal replied in affirmative, Janak Singh told that they would not allow him to do so.\n",
      "3.  Thereafter both accused Janak Singh and Sarvesh fired upon Khetrapal who fell down on the ground on receiving gunshot injuries. When Bhuri Singh and Surjeet Singh (PW-7) tried to save Khetrapal, they were also fired upon by the accused persons and they also sustained fire arm injuries. When deceased Khetrapal fell down on the ground accused Sarvesh fired at Khetrapal from his gun, resulting in Khetrapal's instantaneous death. Bhuri Singh (PW-1) then lodged the first information report, which was ascribed by Ram Singh at police station Etmadpur on the same day at 1.30 p.m., the distance of police station being 4 miles from the place of occurrence. On the basis of the written report, chik First Information Report was prepared by the Head Moharrir, Bihari Ji Yadav and the case was registered in the General Diary. The Station Officer Mahabir Singh took up investigation and interrogated Bhuri Singh and Surjeet Singh at the police station itself and sent both of them to hospital for medical examination with constable Lajja Ram. The investigation was undertaken and on completion thereof charge sheet was placed and accused persons faced trial. To substantiate its accusations the prosecution examined 8 witnesses. Though PWs 1 and 7 were stated to be eyewitnesses who had sustained injuries during the occurrence, PW-7 resiled from the statement given during investigation. So, the prosecution case rested on the testimony of PW-1 the injured eyewitness. The Trial Court found that his evidence was credible and cogent and conviction was made as noted above.\n",
      "4.   The main stand of the accused persons before the High Court was that evidence of PW-1 did not inspire confidence as it was at a great variance with the medical evidence. Therefore, he being an interested person who would be beneficiary if the accused persons are convicted, without corroboration his evidence should not be acted upon. The specific plea regarding the variation of PW-1's evidence vis-a-vis medical evidence was with reference to distance. According to the doctor, the gun shot which caused injury was fired from a distance of about 3-4 ft. According to PW- 1, the distance was about 20-25 ft. The Trial Court noticed that PW-1 was a person who even did not know how to sign and gave thumb impression. His perception of distance being that of a layman, no undue importance should be attached to the estimated distance. Similar plea raised before the High Court also did not find acceptance.\n",
      "5.   In support of the appeal, Mr. U.R. Lalit, learned senior counsel, submitted that PW-1's evidence is not credible and cogent. The High Court should not have tried to lightly brush aside the inconsistency clearly noticeable between his evidence and that of the doctor who stated that the injuries found in the body of the deceased could be caused if gun shot was done from a short distance. Further, there was no effort made to seize the gun allegedly used by A-2. That would have shown whether the injuries sustained could have been caused by the gun allegedly used by the accused persons. There was no injury on the backside and the only injury noticed on PW-1 was near the eyebrow. It was submitted that S. 34 IPC has no application.\n",
      "6.   In response, learned counsel for the State supported the judgments and submitted that concurrent findings recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court on analysing the evidence should not be disturbed.\n",
      "7.   We shall first deal with the plea regarding the alleged inconsistency between the eyewitness version and the medical evidence as to the distance from which the gun was fired. Where direct evidence of the eyewitness is that the accused committed the murder by firing a gun some inconsistency relating to distance based on medical opinion offered would be of no significance whatsoever. (See Karnail Singh and Others v. The State of Punjab (AIR 1971 SC 2119 1971 Indlaw SC 621). The view in Karnail Singh's case 1971 Indlaw SC 621 (supra) was also reiterated in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Sughar Singh and Others. (AIR 1978 SC 191 1977 Indlaw SC 291).\n",
      "8.  S. 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The Section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the Section is the element of participation in action. The liability of one person for an offence committed by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated by several persons arises under S. 34 if such criminal act is done in furtherance of a common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime. Direct proof of common intention is seldom available and, therefore, such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. In order to bring home the charge of common intention, the prosecution has to establish by evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are charged with the aid of Section 34, be it pre-arranged or on the spur of moment; but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime.\n",
      "9.  The true contents of the Section is that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v. State of Punjab (AIR 1977 SC 109 1976 Indlaw SC 468), the existence of a common intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of this Section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common intention in order to attract the provision.\n",
      "10.   As it originally stood the S. 34 was in the following terms:\n",
      "\"When a criminal act is done by several persons, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone: In 1870, it was amended by the insertion of the words \"in furtherance of the common intention of all\" after the word \"persons\" and before the word \"each\", so as to make the object of S. 34 clear. This position was noted in Mahbub Shah v. Emperor (AIR 1945 Privy Council 118 1945 Indlaw PC 14).\n",
      "11.  The Section does not say \"the common intention of all\", nor does it say \"and intention common to all\". Under the provisions of S. 34 the essence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. As a result of the application of principles enunciated in Section 34, when an accused is convicted u/s. 302 read with Section 34, in law it means that the accused is liable for the act which caused death of the deceased in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be difficult to distinguish between acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common intention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. As was observed in Ch. Pulla Reddy and Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1993 SC 1899 1993 Indlaw SC 1030), S. 34 is applicable even if no injury has been caused by the particular accused himself. For applying S. 34 it is not necessary to show some overt act on the part of the accused. The legality of conviction by applying S. 34 IPC in the absence of such charge was examined in several cases. In Willie (William) Slaney v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1956 SC 116 1955 Indlaw SC 80) it was held as follows:\n",
      "\"Sections 34, 114 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention; and the charge is a rolled up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable. In such a situation, the absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by itself, and before a conviction for the substantive offence, without a charge, can be set aside, prejudice will have to be made out. In most of the cases of this kind, evidence is normally given from the outset as to who was primarily responsible for the act which brought about the offence and such evidence is of course relevant\".\n",
      "12.  The above position was re-iterated in Dhanna etc. v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1996 SC 2478 1996 Indlaw SC 2240).\n",
      "13.  S. 34 IPC has clear application to the facts of the case, and seems to have been rightly and properly applied also.\n",
      "14.  Though the evidence of PW-1 was assailed on the ground that he is the beneficiary if accused persons are convicted, we find he had sustained injuries. His evidence was carefully analysed by the courts below and we do not find any noticeable discrepancy in his evidence to discard it.\n",
      "15.  The judgments of the Trial Court and the High Court are well-reasoned with conclusions and finding recorded therein supported by ample, concrete and relevant evidence and consequently the conviction suffers from no infirmity to warrant any interference. It is not a fit case where jurisdiction u/art. 136 of the Constitution of India needs to be exercised. The appeal is dismissed. The accused persons who are on bail are directed to surrender to custody forthwith to serve remainder of sentence.\n",
